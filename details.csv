It's a good thing, and they need to bring it to market and keep iterating and improving and make better and better electric cars, and that's what going to result in humanity achieving a sustainable transport future. I wish it was growing faster than it is.


"
Elon Musk,"

I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.


"
Elon Musk,"

We're running the most dangerous experiment in history right now, which is to see how much carbon dioxide the atmosphere... can handle before there is an environmental catastrophe.


"
Elon Musk,"

Really, the only thing that makes sense is to strive for greater collective enlightenment.


"
Elon Musk,"

Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time. Sometimes it will be ahead, other times it will be behind. But brand is simply a collective impression some have about a product.


"
Elon Musk,"

I always invest my own money in the companies that I create. I don't believe in the whole thing of just using other people's money. I don't think that's right. I'm not going to ask other people to invest in something if I'm not prepared to do so myself.


"
Elon Musk,"

Self-driving cars are the natural extension of active safety and obviously something we should do.


"

Starting a business is not for everyone. Starting a business - I'd say, number one is have a high pain threshold.

Rockets are cool. There's no getting around that.


"
Elon Musk,"

Any product that needs a manual to work is broken.


"
Elon Musk,"

There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing.


"
Elon Musk,"

I think life on Earth must be about more than just solving problems... It's got to be something inspiring, even if it is vicarious.

I think we have a duty to maintain the light of consciousness to make sure it continues into the future.

I don't create companies for the sake of creating companies, but to get things done.


"
Elon Musk,"

If we drive down the cost of transportation in space, we can do great things.


"
Elon Musk,"

The reality is gas prices should be much more expensive then they are because we're not incorporating the true damage to the environment and the hidden costs of mining oil and transporting it to the U.S. Whenever you have an unpriced externality, you have a bit of a market failure, to the degree that eternality remains unpriced.


"
Elon Musk,"

I say something, and then it usually happens. Maybe not on schedule, but it usually happens.


"
Elon Musk,"

If humanity doesn't land on Mars in my lifetime, I would be very disappointed.


"
Elon Musk,"

We can't have, like, willy-nilly proliferation of fake news. That's crazy. You can't have more types of fake news than real news. That's allowing public deception to go unchecked. That's crazy.


"
Elon Musk,"

When I was a child, there's one thing I said: 'I never want to be alone.' That's what I would say. I don't want to be alone.


"
Elon Musk,"

If you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic - being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.


"
Elon Musk,"

There's a silly notion that failure's not an option at NASA. Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.

Elon Musk,"

The value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear: I'm not trying to be anyone's savior. I'm just trying to think about the future and not be sad.


"
Elon Musk,"

The path to the CEO's office should not be through the CFO's office, and it should not be through the marketing department. It needs to be through engineering and design.


"
Elon Musk,"

If you're entering anything where there's an existing marketplace, against large, entrenched competitors, then your product or service needs to be much better than theirs. It can't be a little bit better, because then you put yourself in the shoes of the consumer... you're always going to buy the trusted brand unless there's a big difference.


"
Elon Musk,"

The problem is that at a lot of big companies, process becomes a substitute for thinking. You're encouraged to behave like a little gear in a complex machine. Frankly, it allows you to keep people who aren't that smart, who aren't that creative.


"
Elon Musk,"

A company is a group organized to create a product or service, and it is only as good as its people and how excited they are about creating. I do want to recognize a ton of super-talented people. I just happen to be the face of the companies.


"
Elon Musk,"

The factory is the machine that builds the machine.


"
Elon Musk,"

I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better.


"
Elon Musk,"

I wouldn't say I have a lack of fear. In fact, I'd like my fear emotion to be less because it's very distracting and fries my nervous system.


"
Elon Musk,"

I hate writing about personal stuff. I don't have a Facebook page. I don't use my Twitter account. I am familiar with both, but I don't use them.


"
Elon Musk,"

An asteroid or a supervolcano could certainly destroy us, but we also face risks the dinosaurs never saw: An engineered virus, nuclear war, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us.


"

We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.


"
Swami Vivekananda,"

Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.

In one word, this ideal is that you are divine.


"
Swami Vivekananda,"

Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and in every living being.

"
Swami Vivekananda,"

That man has reached immortality who is disturbed by nothing material.


"
Swami Vivekananda,"

All differences in this world are of degree, and not of kind, because oneness is the secret of everything.


"
Swami Vivekananda,"

Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It is the greatest heresy to think so. If there is sin, this is the only sin; to say that you are weak, or others are weak.


"
Swami Vivekananda,"

The Vedanta recognizes no sin it only recognizes error. And the greatest error, says the Vedanta is to say that you are weak, that you are a sinner, a miserable creature, and that you have no power and you cannot do this and that.

"
Swami Vivekananda,"

The will is not free - it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect - but there is something behind the will which is free.


"
Swami Vivekananda,"

If money help a man to do good to others, it is of some value; but if not, it is simply a mass of evil, and the sooner it is got rid of, the better.


"
Swami Vivekananda,"

As different streams having different sources all mingle their waters in the sea, so different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to God.


"

Nelson Mandela,"

A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Where globalization means, as it so often does, that the rich and powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and weaker, we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

As long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality persist in our world, none of us can truly rest.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer, and thus emerge stronger. You don't have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Forget the past.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Let freedom reign. The sun never set on so glorious a human achievement.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

No country can really develop unless its citizens are educated.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

When the water starts boiling it is foolish to turn off the heat.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

In my country we go to prison first and then become President.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

If there are dreams about a beautiful South Africa, there are also roads that lead to their goal. Two of these roads could be named Goodness and Forgiveness.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I stand here before you not as a prophet, but as a humble servant of you, the people.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I was called a terrorist yesterday, but when I came out of jail, many people embraced me, including my enemies, and that is what I normally tell other people who say those who are struggling for liberation in their country are terrorists.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

It is wise to persuade people to do things and make them think it was their own idea.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

There is no such thing as part freedom.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I do not deny that I planned sabotage. I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity's belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul, and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Without education, your children can never really meet the challenges they will face. So it's very important to give children education and explain that they should play a role for their country.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

After one has been in prison, it is the small things that one appreciates: being able to take a walk whenever one wants, going into a shop and buying a newspaper, speaking or choosing to remain silent. The simple act of being able to control one's person.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I dream of an Africa which is in peace with itself.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Even if you have a terminal disease, you don't have to sit down and mope. Enjoy life and challenge the illness that you have.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I dream of the realization of the unity of Africa, whereby its leaders combine in their efforts to solve the problems of this continent. I dream of our vast deserts, of our forests, of all our great wildernesses.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Communists have always played an active role in the fight by colonial countries for their freedom, because the short-term objects of Communism would always correspond with the long-term objects of freedom movements.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Nonviolence is a good policy when the conditions permit.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

There are many people who feel that it is useless and futile to continue talking about peace and non-violence against a government whose only reply is savage attacks on an unarmed and defenseless people.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Does anybody really think that they didn't get what they had because they didn't have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment?


"
Nelson Mandela,"

People respond in accordance to how you relate to them. If you approach them on the basis of violence, that's how they'll react. But if you say, 'We want peace, we want stability,' we can then do a lot of things that will contribute towards the progress of our society.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I would wear the blue overalls of the fieldworker and often wore round, rimless glasses known as Mazzawati teaglasses. I had a car, and I wore a chauffeur's cap with my overalls. The pose of chauffeur was convenient because I could travel under the pretext of driving my master's car.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Running taught me valuable lessons. In cross-country competition, training counted more than intrinsic ability, and I could compensate for a lack of natural aptitude with diligence and discipline. I applied this in everything I did.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

My son has died of AIDS.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

On the first day of school, my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English name and said that from thenceforth that was the name we would answer to in school. This was the custom among Africans in those days and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I am confident that nobody... will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time, while I am still in good health, with my family, my friends and also with myself.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I should tie myself to no particular system of society other than of socialism.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

Unlike some politicians, I can admit to a mistake.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

We can't afford to be killing one another.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

I cannot say for certain if there is such a thing as love at first sight, but I do know that the moment I first glimpsed Winnie Nomzamo, I knew that I wanted to have her as my wife.


"
Nelson Mandela,"

In countries where innocent people are dying, the leaders are following their blood rather than their brains.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Love knows not distance; it hath no continent; its eyes are for the stars.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

For when a child is born the mother also is born again.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

There is no refuge from memory and remorse in this world. The spirits of our foolish deeds haunt us, with or without repentance.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

The real business of life is trying to understand each other.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Memory is man's greatest friend and worst enemy.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

War is cruelty, and none can make it gentle.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Nothing is so unproductive as the law. It is expensive whether you win or lose.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

There is no influence like the influence of habit.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

He came by a leap to the goal of purpose, not by the toilsome steps of reason. On the instant his headlong spirit declared his purpose: this was the one being for him in all the world: at this altar he would light a lamp of devotion, and keep it burning forever.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

It is not the broken heart that kills, but broken pride, monseigneur.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Every shot that kills ricochets.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

It's the people who try to be clever who never are; the people who are clever never think of trying to be.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Man is born in a day, and he dies in a day, and the thing is easily over; but to have a sick heart for three-fourths of one's lifetime is simply to have death renewed every morning; and life at that price is not worth living.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

He knew the lie of silence to be as evil as the lie of speech.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

She belongs to a race of delightful women, who never do any harm, whom everybody calls good, and who are very severe on those who do not pretend to be good.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

It must be remembered that the sea is a great breeder of friendship. Two men who have known each other for twenty years find that twenty days at sea bring them nearer than ever they were before, or else estrange them.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Every man should have laws of his own, I should think; commandments of his own, for every man has a different set of circumstances wherein to work - or worry.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Imagination is at the root of much that passes for love.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

But paying is part of the game of life: it is the joy of buying that we crave.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

In all secrets there is a kind of guilt, however beautiful or joyful they may be, or for what good end they may be set to serve. Secrecy means evasion, and evasion means a problem to the moral mind.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

There's no credit in not doing what you don't want to do. There's no virtue in not falling, when you're not tempted.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Tomorrow is no man's gift.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Always Do Your Best. Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Don't Take Anything Personally. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

People like to say that the conflict is between good and evil. The real conflict is between truth and lies.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Don't Make Assumptions. Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Just imagine becoming the way you used to be as a very young child, before you understood the meaning of any word, before opinions took over your mind. The real you is loving, joyful, and free. The real you is just like a flower, just like the wind, just like the ocean, just like the sun.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

We only see what we want to see; we only hear what we want to hear. Our belief system is just like a mirror that only shows us what we believe.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Every human is an artist. The dream of your life is to make beautiful art.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Life is like dancing. If we have a big floor, many people will dance. Some will get angry when the rhythm changes. But life is changing all the time.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

When we believe in lies, we cannot see the truth, so we make thousands of assumptions and we take them as truth. One of the biggest assumptions we make is that the lies we believe are the truth!


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

When we respect everybody around us, we are in peace with everybody around us.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Humans believe so many lies because we aren't aware. We ignore the truth or we just don't see the truth. When we are educated, we accumulate a lot of knowledge, and all that knowledge is just like a wall of fog that doesn't allow us to perceive the truth, what really is.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive - the risk to be alive and express what we really are.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Love is unknown. To open the heart in trust is unknown. They say love hurts. It doesn't have to.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Before we were born, a whole society of storytellers was already here. The storytellers who were here before us taught us how to be human.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

The same way that you are the main character of your story, you are only a secondary character in everybody else's story.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Always do your best.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

The word is a force you cannot see, but you can see the manifestation of that force, the expression of the word, which is your own life.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

For thousands of years, there have been lies about being gay or not being gay. If you know they're lies, you're free.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Life is very, very simple and easy to understand, but we complicate it with the beliefs and ideas that we create.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

I love and respect all religions and philosophies. I see how they get formed, how they grow up, and how powerful they are. But for me to believe in a specific god - no. Because what I believe is that the infinite, the absolute, is a living being and the only one living being that really exists.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Every human is an artist. And this is the main art that we have: the creation of our story.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Everything you think about yourself, everything you believe about yourself, is because you learned it.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

I am here and I'm alive. That's enough.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

We never stop to consider that our beliefs are only a relative truth that's always going to be distorted by all the knowledge we have stored in our memory.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Be Skeptical, but learn to listen.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Be impeccable with your word.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

I can say, 'Well, I'm a male. I'm a male human. I'm a medical doctor. I'm an author...' If I go to a religious point of view, I will say, 'I am a soul. I am a spirit.' If I go into science, I will say, 'I am energy. I am light.' But the truth is I have no idea what I am.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

In our development, as we grow throughout our lives, the structure of our beliefs becomes very complicated, and we make it even more complicated because we make the assumption that what we believe is the absolute truth.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Whatever you perceive, you always make a story with yourself as the main character, and that dictates your life. Then when you read 'The Four Agreements', you hear another voice beneath the story, the voice that comes from your integrity, your spirit.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

You know that if you lie to yourself, surely other people lie to themselves. And if they lie to themselves, they will lie to you also.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

I don't know what I am. And it's not important.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

When you look at yourself in a mirror, do you like what you see, or do you judge your body and use the word to tell yourself lies? If you believe that you are not attractive enough, then you believe a lie, and you are using the word against yourself, against the truth.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Listen to other people tell their story, but don't believe them. You know that it's just a story that is only true for them, but listen because the communication can be wonderful.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

To the nameless and unsung heroes of our freedom struggle, we offer our humble tribute. Their life-blood nourishes the body of independent India.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

In Kashmir, you need utmost cooperation between all centres of authority.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I don't think that NTR is anti-Indian.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I think we will be able to work with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to reduce tension and concentrate efforts in both the countries on real problems of the people - poverty, social injustice, and development.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I have never felt vulnerable nor restricted in my movements.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

There is no problem between Giani Zail Singh and Rajiv Gandhi.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

For some days, people thought that India was shaking. But there are always tremors when a great tree falls.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I think of those giants who made the Indian National Congress. Seldom has the world seen a nobler galaxy of women and men, so selfless in their devotion to the cause of freedom, so exalted in thought, so brave in action, so pure in spirit.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

The freedom movement transformed the status of women. Women fought along with men as comrades. In the process, the shackles that had bound them fell away.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We must remember that self-reliance and eradication of poverty demands - indeed, compel - the present generation to bear hardship and make sacrifices. Those who are employed have a duty to the future of India. They have to be more productive and consume less so that resources can be made available for investment and for programmes to help poor.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I didn't have any personal goals when I came, but after being in politics - after seeing people, their difficulties, their wants - I think our goal has to be to eliminate poverty from India.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

The secretariat will play a pivotal role in decision-making above a certain level, where basic policies are involved, but below that, we will have to leave the implementation to whoever is in charge.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I find I have less time for everything. The assembly elections came so soon, and there is still so much work to be done.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

Indiraji should have been here today, speaking to you in her gentle, impassioned voice. One with Bharatmata's immortal spirit, she now shines as a lodestar not only for us but for all humanity.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

Civilizations are built by the ceaseless toil of a succession of generations. With softness and sloth, civilizations succumb. Let us beware of decadence.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We took such a beating on Bofors. As far as I know, no one from my government was involved.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

Even before V. P. Singh was shifted, the media was creating an impression that he was facing difficulties. This was totally incorrect.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I think what Punjab needs today is vigorous economic development and rebuilding of trust and social cohesion.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

There has to be a national consensus. We cannot legislate without overwhelming national consensus that religious and communal groups should be totally banned from politics.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We have been making changes continuously. You cannot expect everything to be perfect the minute it is made. Things change; they are dynamic as you progress. The requirements change. Demands change. So you change with that.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We are committed to the development of friendship and good neighbourly relations with Pakistan. I believe that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto shares this commitment.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

In every democracy, it is the people's will that is supreme. We should translate the intense yearning of the people of India and Pakistan for friendship into meaningful measures of cooperation in every walk of life.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I would like to clarify that our opposition to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is not related to any consideration involving Pakistan. Our position on this important issue is consistent and principled. We are not ready to sign the NPT as it stands today because it is blatantly discriminatory in character.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

How shall we remember Mahatma Gandhi, that eternal pilgrim of freedom? Born of the very spirit of India, steeped in the tradition, the song, the legend of our ancient land - and yet he was revolutionary. Unique among revolutionaries, he marched for freedom, clad in the robe of truth, with non-violence for his staff.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

To Mahatma Gandhi, the key to India's progress was the development of its villages. In his unified vision, education, agriculture, village industry, social reform all came together to provide the basis for a vibrant rural society free from exploitation and linked to the urban centres as equals. Our planning incorporates this basic insight.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We cannot and will not rest until we have won true swaraj for the hungry and spiritually starving millions - until we have wiped out poverty from our land.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We need a better strategy to achieve the national goal of a stable population, healthier and better educated.


"
Mohanlal,"

Life is a collage of events, really.


"
Mohanlal,"

There comes a turning point in the life of every person when he reflects on his journey and work and ponders on the next road to take. Is this the pinnacle, the ultimate? What next?


"
Mohanlal,"

Cinema is an art form, a result of dedication of a number of people.


"
Mohanlal,"

Friendship is accepting a person with all their qualities - good and bad.


"
Mohanlal,"

I don't hope for anything. Not only in my professional life, but in my family life also. My total lifestyle is like that.

Robert de Niro is my favourite actor.

People want to see other's secrets and get a peek into their lives.

I believe that football can inspire youngsters to find the path of success in life.


"
Mohanlal,"

Destiny plays a very important role in my life.


"
Mohanlal,"

I have a shot a lot of movies in Dubai.


"
Mohanlal,"

People know I am not blind or have super strength, yet they believed in my characters in 'Oppam' and 'Pulimurugan.' It's that belief of the audience that is also my greatest strength. Once that is gone, I might have to shut up shop and look for another job.


"
Mohanlal,"

Being an actor doesn't mean that I can't react to what's happening around me.


"
Mohanlal,"

I acted in my first film while in my second year of degree college, in 1978.


"
Mohanlal,"

It's a great honour for me to be a part of a Kamal Haasan film.


"
Mohanlal,"

My first film was 'Thiranottam.' I cannot discount that film because I got initiated into films with it.


"
Mohanlal,"

Cinema has given me everything in life, and I will continue acting till the end.


"
Mohanlal,"

There is no big problem in the Malayalam industry. You shouldn't think of the #MeToo as a movement, actually. It is a fad, and it is turning into something of a fashion. Anything like that will have a lifespan for a bit.


"
Mohanlal,"

I studied, gained friends, became a father, faced the clipboard unexpectedly for the first time, earned some beautiful moments with family and buddies in Thiruvananthapuram.


"
Mohanlal,"

I liked the concept of 'Lucifer.'


"
Mohanlal,"

I know it's a craze in Bollywood to have six-pack abs, but here, it's not the abs or the biceps that make us feel or look macho. Down south, the moustache still works for us!


"
Mohanlal,"

TV has the most reach among the audience. Movies are watched only by those who like cinema.


"
Mohanlal,"

Every actor or director has their ups and downs.


"
Mohanlal,"

I do all my films happily, and I enjoy every moment of it.


"
Mohanlal,"

In developed countries, strong rules are in place to restrict sound pollution and curb its deadly effects. As law-abiding citizens with social responsibility, we should all come together against this unhealthy trend.


"
Mohanlal,"

There was a time when not many people had access to Malayalam films. So those who did have access went on to copy the films, add a few bits, and present it like it was their own.


"
Mohanlal,"

I own a couple of restaurants in places like Dubai and Sharjah.


"
Mohanlal,"

Kunjali Marakkar is one of the first naval commanders of Kerala. He was an expert at his craft.


"
Mohanlal,"

Many talented actors have come into this industry and, in spite of their best efforts, haven't been able to win over the audience.


"
Mohanlal,"

I have learned to take things as they come.


"
Mohanlal,"

All my films can't be like 'Narasimham.'


"
Mohanlal,"

I have seen 'A Wednesday,' and it is a wonderful film.


"
Mohanlal,"

Even in Hollywood, filmmakers are re-creating classics at regular intervals.


"
Mohanlal,"

I generally have confidence in my directors.


"
Mohanlal,"

I don't get bored at all while acting.


"
Mohanlal,"

In the Indian system of filmmaking, you don't plan well in advance, stick to a storyboard, or deliver only the scripted lines.


"
Mohanlal,"

Death can come at any time to anyone. Everybody is equal before death.


"
Mohanlal,"

I have been writing my blog for several years. Whenever I have written about pertinent subjects, no one has supported them. For instance, the stray dog menace. I cycle in the morning every day, and I am still scared of stray dog attacks.


"
Mohanlal,"

If you ask me whether I can direct, I can. In fact, I have shot several songs, scenes and stunts. When certain directors of my movies were not able to be there for some reason and had asked me to help out, I have directed. But to helm an entire movie is a different art altogether.


"
Mohanlal,"

Be it cinema or TV, I have always been interested in taking up challenging projects.


"
Mohanlal,"

'Oppam' is more of a director's movie, especially because I play a visually-challenged hero in it. The character doesn't have a perspective, and so cameras aren't placed like how they are usually done in other movies. The angles and the way the scenes are captured are different.


"
Mohanlal,"

You feel hurt when you hear things which you are supposed to have said, which you wouldn't even have given a thought to.


"
Mohanlal,"

When I was in school, I used to go to the Pangode army camp, a stone's throw away from where I was staying in Mudavanmugal in Poojapura, just to watch the army parade.


"
Mohanlal,"

I work, or spend much of my time with the same friends who were with me right from my first movie.


"
Mohanlal,"

The entertainment industry is humungous, and people have so many choices right now - they can watch web series, movies, stand-up comedies, and plays.


"
Mohanlal,"

I love to take some holidays. In fact, I am a guy who wants to take a break for at least 10 days after each movie.


"
Mohanlal,"

Films are not meant to be watched only by fans but by everyone. Fans are those who like what we do. When we do things that only they like, then we are becoming their fans.


"
Mohanlal,"

Once the director calls for action, we act; we stop when he says 'Cut.' It is sort of like meditation - unknowingly, you are moving out of yourself, becoming someone else. That is why I consider acting a form of meditation.


"
Mohanlal,"

The thing about movies is that till it goes on floors, it's just preparations for the film.


"
Mohanlal,"

Morality depends on individual freedom, and it requires some sense to know where to draw the line.


"
Mohanlal,"

Every actor, director, and producer want all their films to do well. So you choose the role carefully, listen to the script, and work hard. But there is no way of predicting whether it will be a hit or a flop.


"
Mohanlal,"

I was not the producer of 'Vaanaprastham' earlier. The first producers backed out when they became doubtful about the monetary benefits. I do not blame them. But as an actor, I wanted to make the film. So, I told Shaji sir that I would produce the film. It was only then we started shooting.


"
Mohanlal,"

I was into movies before my graduation results got out. In fact, I was on location of a movie when they came.


"
Mohanlal,"

India has a law. The political parties or the religious heads have no right to control that law.


"
Mohanlal,"

It's my right to write on what I feel about certain incidents, and it's your choice whether to read it or not.


"
Mohanlal,"

All my success belongs to those who have contributed in my pursuit of art, ranging from writers and directors to makeup artists, lighting crew, etc.


"
Mohanlal,"

Just like films, food is also a passion for me.


"
Mohanlal,"

Sometimes, you fall into a ditch without knowing it is there, without seeing it, but you try to come out of it. If you fall again, you will jump out again.


"
Mohanlal,"

I feel there is an unknown energy pushing me to do certain things in life.


"
Mohanlal,"

It's not enough that you act in a movie - if it has to work, the audience should like it.


"
Mohanlal,"

For me, every film is an interesting experience.

We can't command our love, but we can our actions.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

For strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.


"

Our ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

There is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

As a rule, said Holmes, the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

The most difficult crime to track is the one which is purposeless.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

To the man who loves art for its own sake, it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

From a drop of water a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

The ideal reasoner, he remarked, would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example.

Arthur Conan Doyle,"

I have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Sir Walter, with his 61 years of life, although he never wrote a novel until he was over 40, had, fortunately for the world, a longer working career than most of his brethren.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

You will, I am sure, agree with me that... if page 534 only finds us in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable.


"
James Madison,"

Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.

Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of liberty, but also by the abuse of power.

The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe with blood for centuries.


"
James Madison,"

Philosophy is common sense with big words.


"
James Madison,"

I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.


"
James Madison,"

The truth is that all men having power ought to be mistrusted.


"
James Madison,"

The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.


"
James Madison,"

It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.


"
James Madison,"

The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.


"
James Madison,"

And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed, as every past one has done, in showing that religion and Government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.


"
James Madison,"

The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived.


"
James Madison,"

Wherever there is interest and power to do wrong, wrong will generally be done.


"
James Madison,"

A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained in arms, is the best most natural defense of a free country.


"
James Madison,"

What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?


"
James Madison,"

Let me recommend the best medicine in the world: a long journey, at a mild season, through a pleasant country, in easy stages.


"
James Madison,"

The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.


"
James Madison,"

A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce, or a tragedy, or perhaps both.


"
James Madison,"

Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise, every expanded prospect.


"
James Madison,"

As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed.


"
James Madison,"

It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad.


"
James Madison,"

In Republics, the great danger is, that the majority may not sufficiently respect the rights of the minority.


"
James Madison,"

A well-instructed people alone can be permanently a free people.


"
James Madison,"

A pure democracy is a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.


"
James Madison,"

The happy Union of these States is a wonder; their Constitution a miracle; their example the hope of Liberty throughout the world.


"
James Madison,"

In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.


"
James Madison,"

America was indebted to immigration for her settlement and prosperity. That part of America which had encouraged them most had advanced most rapidly in population, agriculture and the arts.


"
James Madison,"

The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.


"
James Madison,"

No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.


"
James Madison,"

The capacity of the female mind for studies of the highest order cannot be doubted, having been sufficiently illustrated by its works of genius, of erudition, and of science.


"

Americans have the right and advantage of being armed - unlike the citizens of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.


"
James Madison,"

We are right to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties.


"
James Madison,"

The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the state governments, in times of peace and security.


"
James Madison,"

A sincere and steadfast co-operation in promoting such a reconstruction of our political system as would provide for the permanent liberty and happiness of the United States.


"
James Madison,"

Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties, or his possessions.


"
James Madison,"

The Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.


"
James Madison,"

A man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them.


"
James Madison,"

The class of citizens who provide at once their own food and their own raiment, may be viewed as the most truly independent and happy.


"
James Madison,"

Despotism can only exist in darkness, and there are too many lights now in the political firmament to permit it to remain anywhere, as it has heretofore done, almost everywhere.


"
James Madison,"

To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.


"
James Madison,"

Of all the enemies of public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.


"
James Madison,"

There is no maxim, in my opinion, which is more liable to be misapplied, and which, therefore, more needs elucidation, than the current one, that the interest of the majority is the political standard of right and wrong.


"
James Madison,"

The executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.


"
James Madison,"

War should only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits.


"
James Madison,"

As a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.


"
James Madison,"

Each generation should be made to bear the burden of its own wars, instead of carrying them on, at the expense of other generations.

Every nation whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of its wiser neighbors.


"
James Madison,"

Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Government.


"
James Madison,"

All men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree.


"
James Madison,"

To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.


"
James Madison,"

The number, the industry, and the morality of the priesthood, and the devotion of the people have been manifestly increased by the total separation of the church from the state.


"
James Madison,"

I should not regret a fair and full trial of the entire abolition of capital punishment.


"
James Madison,"

What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed?


"
James Madison,"

Whenever a youth is ascertained to possess talents meriting an education which his parents cannot afford, he should be carried forward at the public expense.


"
James Madison,"

Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.


"
James Madison,"

Commercial shackles are generally unjust, oppressive, and impolitic.


"
James Madison,"

War contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason.


"
James Madison,"

If we are to take for the criterion of truth the majority of suffrages, they ought to be gotten from those philosophic and patriotic citizens who cultivate their reason.

Jack Ma,"

Never give up. Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine.


"
Jack Ma,"

I call Alibaba '1,001 mistakes.' We expanded too fast, and then in the dot-com bubble, we had to have layoffs. By 2002, we had only enough cash to survive for 18 months. We had a lot of free members using our site, and we didn't know how we'd make money. So we developed a product for China exporters to meet U.S. buyers online. This model saved us.


"
Jack Ma,"

You should learn from your competitor, but never copy. Copy and you die.


"
Jack Ma,"

Spending money is much more difficult than making money.


"
Jack Ma,"

I don't want to be liked. I want to be respected.


"
Jack Ma,"

We should keep on going along the path of globalization. Globalization is good... when trade stops, war comes.


"
Jack Ma,"

When I am myself, I am happy and have a good result.


"
Jack Ma,"

There are big problems that change the world. If we are working together, that will make us understand each other, appreciate each other, help each other.


"
Jack Ma,"

Help young people. Help small guys. Because small guys will be big. Young people will have the seeds you bury in their minds, and when they grow up, they will change the world.


"
Jack Ma,"

The lessons I learned from the dark days at Alibaba are that you've got to make your team have value, innovation, and vision. Also, if you don't give up, you still have a chance. And, when you are small, you have to be very focused and rely on your brain, not your strength.


"
Jack Ma,"

My vision is to build an e-commerce ecosystem that allows consumers and businesses to do all aspects of business online.


"
Jack Ma,"

Trust the young people; trust this generation's innovation. They're making things, changing innovation every day. And all the consumers are the same: they want new things, they want cheap things, they want good things, they want unique things. If we can create these kind of things for consumers, they will come.


"
Jack Ma,"

The very important thing you should have is patience.


"
Jack Ma,"

The world needs new leadership, but the new leadership is about working together.


"
Jack Ma,"

I don't think I'm a workaholic. Every weekend, I invite my colleagues and friends to my home to play cards. And people, my neighbors, are always surprised because I live on the second floor apartment, and there are usually 40 pairs of shoes in front of my gate, and people play cards inside and play chess. We have a lot of fun.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm not a tech guy. I'm looking at the technology with the eyes of my customers, normal people's eyes.


"
Jack Ma,"

I don't want people in China to have deep pockets but shallow minds.


"
Jack Ma,"

A trade war would be a disaster for the world. It's very easy to slip into a trade war.


"
Jack Ma,"

I even don't dare to watch our stock price, because this is what other people think who you are. I dare not watch it. I think, let the market take care of themselves; we should take care of the business.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm coming to this world not to work. I want to come to this world to enjoy my life. I don't want to die in my office. I want to die on the beaches.


"
Jack Ma,"

My job is making money, helping other people make money. I am spending money, trying to make sure more people get rich, because you cannot spend a lot of money, right? So my job is spending money, helping others. This is a headache.


"
Jack Ma,"

Trade is a communication of cultures and values.


"
Jack Ma,"

A startup for entrepreneurs is like a baby, and I have five babies so far - experienced father.


"
Jack Ma,"

I know nothing about technology.


"
Jack Ma,"

A peace talk is always difficult, always complicated.


"
Jack Ma,"

There's an examination for young people to go to university. I failed it three times. I failed a lot. So I applied to 30 different jobs and got rejected. I went for a job with the police; they said, 'You're no good.' I even went to KFC when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job. Twenty-three were accepted.


"
Jack Ma,"

Today the financial market is no good, but the money is there.


"
Jack Ma,"

The most important thing is to make the technology inclusive - make the world change. Next, pay attention to those people who are 30 years old, because those are the internet generation. They will change the world; they are the builders of the world.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm a normal guy.


"
Jack Ma,"

The difference between Amazon and us is Amazon is more like an empire - everything they control themselves, buy and sell.


"
Jack Ma,"

The name Jack was given by an American tourist.


"
Jack Ma,"

As a company, we have to be very transparent. We are in a business very related to finance, and I want this company to last long, and I want this company to be audited by everyone.


"
Jack Ma,"

EBay is a great company. There are a lot of good assets and good customers, and the U.S. people love it.


"
Jack Ma,"

When we started the e-commerce, nobody believed that China would have e-commerce because people believed in 'guang-shi,' face-to-face, and all kinds of network in traditional ways. There's no trust system in China.


"
Jack Ma,"

Before I left China, I was educated that China was the richest, happiest country in the world. So when I arrived Australia, I thought, 'Oh my God, everything is different from what I was told.' Since then, I started to think differently.


"
Jack Ma,"

You American people worry too much about the China economy. Every time you think China is a problem, we get better, but when you have a high expectation for China, China is always a problem.


"
Jack Ma,"

I don't care about revenues.


"
Jack Ma,"

Every time there's an election, people start to criticize China.


"
Jack Ma,"

I try to make myself happy, no, because I know that if I'm not happy, my colleagues are not happy and my shareholders are not happy and my customers are not happy.


"
Jack Ma,"

I think U.S. and Chinese businesses need a common language and dialogue.


"
Jack Ma,"

China's government is so strong on investment, so strong on exporting, but they're too weak on domestic consumption.


"
Jack Ma,"

My job is to help more people have jobs.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm humble 'cause I think many years ago people say, 'Well, Alibaba's terrible company'. And I know we were not that terrible. We're pretty good; we're better than people thought. But today, when people have a high expectation on you, and I start to worry and nervous because we are not good yet.


"
Jack Ma,"

I want people to learn what democracy means.


"
Jack Ma,"

I think globalization is a great thing. And now a lot of people complain about globalization; a lot of people don't like, you know, the globalize of the concept, the idea of the results. I think the globalization is a great idea and to create a lot of jobs.


"
Jack Ma,"

Chinese people, young people, they don't go shopping a lot in department stores. All department store guys hate me. They say business is bad because of Jack.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm just a purist. What is important in my life is that I can do something that can influence many people and influence China's development. When I am myself, I am relaxed and happy and have a good result.


"
Jack Ma,"

The American multinational companies made millions and millions of dollars from globalization.


"
Jack Ma,"

Nobody wanted to believe Jack Ma.


"
Jack Ma,"

If you're doing business, not that simple to only buy. You have to create something. You have to create something that never exist for the future.


"
Jack Ma,"

What a publication can do is to help people get a clearer picture without jumping to any rash conclusion. I'm very happy that the 'Post' can take the responsibility to report on China in a broader and deeper way. I believe the 'Post' must be fair to our readers. We should let our readers see China from more angles and perspectives.


"
Jack Ma,"

China is still the fastest growing economy in the world, but we need to learn how to use money in a better way, and it's about quality, not quantity.


"
Jack Ma,"

On privacy issues, it's just like hundreds of years ago when people said, 'I would rather put my money under my pillow than in a bank.' But today, banks know how to protect money much better than you do. Today, we may not have the answers to privacy issues, but I believe our young people will come up with the solutions.


"
Jack Ma,"

The big businesses are less willing to take risks. I talked to some young people in Hong Kong, and they said they are lost. Young people indeed have fewer opportunities than before. But is it true that there are no more opportunities for them? No!


"
Jack Ma,"

People say, 'Well you know the economy's bad, so China consumption will be low. No, totally different. You Americans love to spend tomorrow's money, and other people's money maybe... We Chinese love to save money.


"
Jack Ma,"

If you want to invest in us, we believe customer number one, employee number two, shareholder number three. If they don't want to buy that, that's fine. If they regret, they can sell us.


"
Jack Ma,"

I think Yahoo is a great company, with great assets.


"
Jack Ma,"

Alibaba is an ecosystem that helps small business to grow.

When I was 12 years old, I went to swim in a lake, and I almost died in that lake because the water was too deep - much deeper than I thought.

Beauty, like ice, our footing does betray; Who can tread sure on the smooth, slippery way: Pleased with the surface, we glide swiftly on, And see the dangers that we cannot shun.

"
Mark Twain,"

Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.

"

He came by a leap to the goal of purpose, not by the toilsome steps of reason. On the instant his headlong spirit declared his purpose: this was the one being for him in all the world: at this altar he would light a lamp of devotion, and keep it burning forever.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

It is not the broken heart that kills, but broken pride, monseigneur.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Every shot that kills ricochets.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

It's the people who try to be clever who never are; the people who are clever never think of trying to be.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Man is born in a day, and he dies in a day, and the thing is easily over; but to have a sick heart for three-fourths of one's lifetime is simply to have death renewed every morning; and life at that price is not worth living.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

He knew the lie of silence to be as evil as the lie of speech.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

She belongs to a race of delightful women, who never do any harm, whom everybody calls good, and who are very severe on those who do not pretend to be good.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

It must be remembered that the sea is a great breeder of friendship. Two men who have known each other for twenty years find that twenty days at sea bring them nearer than ever they were before, or else estrange them.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Every man should have laws of his own, I should think; commandments of his own, for every man has a different set of circumstances wherein to work - or worry.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Imagination is at the root of much that passes for love.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

But paying is part of the game of life: it is the joy of buying that we crave.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

In all secrets there is a kind of guilt, however beautiful or joyful they may be, or for what good end they may be set to serve. Secrecy means evasion, and evasion means a problem to the moral mind.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

There's no credit in not doing what you don't want to do. There's no virtue in not falling, when you're not tempted.


"
Gilbert Parker,"

Tomorrow is no man's gift.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Always Do Your Best. Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Don't Take Anything Personally. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

People like to say that the conflict is between good and evil. The real conflict is between truth and lies.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Don't Make Assumptions. Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Just imagine becoming the way you used to be as a very young child, before you understood the meaning of any word, before opinions took over your mind. The real you is loving, joyful, and free. The real you is just like a flower, just like the wind, just like the ocean, just like the sun.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

We only see what we want to see; we only hear what we want to hear. Our belief system is just like a mirror that only shows us what we believe.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Every human is an artist. The dream of your life is to make beautiful art.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Life is like dancing. If we have a big floor, many people will dance. Some will get angry when the rhythm changes. But life is changing all the time.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

When we believe in lies, we cannot see the truth, so we make thousands of assumptions and we take them as truth. One of the biggest assumptions we make is that the lies we believe are the truth!


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

When we respect everybody around us, we are in peace with everybody around us.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Humans believe so many lies because we aren't aware. We ignore the truth or we just don't see the truth. When we are educated, we accumulate a lot of knowledge, and all that knowledge is just like a wall of fog that doesn't allow us to perceive the truth, what really is.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive - the risk to be alive and express what we really are.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Love is unknown. To open the heart in trust is unknown. They say love hurts. It doesn't have to.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Before we were born, a whole society of storytellers was already here. The storytellers who were here before us taught us how to be human.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

The same way that you are the main character of your story, you are only a secondary character in everybody else's story.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Always do your best.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

The word is a force you cannot see, but you can see the manifestation of that force, the expression of the word, which is your own life.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

For thousands of years, there have been lies about being gay or not being gay. If you know they're lies, you're free.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Life is very, very simple and easy to understand, but we complicate it with the beliefs and ideas that we create.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

I love and respect all religions and philosophies. I see how they get formed, how they grow up, and how powerful they are. But for me to believe in a specific god - no. Because what I believe is that the infinite, the absolute, is a living being and the only one living being that really exists.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Every human is an artist. And this is the main art that we have: the creation of our story.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Everything you think about yourself, everything you believe about yourself, is because you learned it.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

I am here and I'm alive. That's enough.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

We never stop to consider that our beliefs are only a relative truth that's always going to be distorted by all the knowledge we have stored in our memory.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Be Skeptical, but learn to listen.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Be impeccable with your word.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

I can say, 'Well, I'm a male. I'm a male human. I'm a medical doctor. I'm an author...' If I go to a religious point of view, I will say, 'I am a soul. I am a spirit.' If I go into science, I will say, 'I am energy. I am light.' But the truth is I have no idea what I am.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

In our development, as we grow throughout our lives, the structure of our beliefs becomes very complicated, and we make it even more complicated because we make the assumption that what we believe is the absolute truth.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Whatever you perceive, you always make a story with yourself as the main character, and that dictates your life. Then when you read 'The Four Agreements', you hear another voice beneath the story, the voice that comes from your integrity, your spirit.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

You know that if you lie to yourself, surely other people lie to themselves. And if they lie to themselves, they will lie to you also.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

I don't know what I am. And it's not important.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

When you look at yourself in a mirror, do you like what you see, or do you judge your body and use the word to tell yourself lies? If you believe that you are not attractive enough, then you believe a lie, and you are using the word against yourself, against the truth.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Listen to other people tell their story, but don't believe them. You know that it's just a story that is only true for them, but listen because the communication can be wonderful.


"
Don Miguel Ruiz,"

Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

To the nameless and unsung heroes of our freedom struggle, we offer our humble tribute. Their life-blood nourishes the body of independent India.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

In Kashmir, you need utmost cooperation between all centres of authority.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I don't think that NTR is anti-Indian.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I think we will be able to work with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to reduce tension and concentrate efforts in both the countries on real problems of the people - poverty, social injustice, and development.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I have never felt vulnerable nor restricted in my movements.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

There is no problem between Giani Zail Singh and Rajiv Gandhi.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

For some days, people thought that India was shaking. But there are always tremors when a great tree falls.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I think of those giants who made the Indian National Congress. Seldom has the world seen a nobler galaxy of women and men, so selfless in their devotion to the cause of freedom, so exalted in thought, so brave in action, so pure in spirit.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

The freedom movement transformed the status of women. Women fought along with men as comrades. In the process, the shackles that had bound them fell away.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We must remember that self-reliance and eradication of poverty demands - indeed, compel - the present generation to bear hardship and make sacrifices. Those who are employed have a duty to the future of India. They have to be more productive and consume less so that resources can be made available for investment and for programmes to help poor.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I didn't have any personal goals when I came, but after being in politics - after seeing people, their difficulties, their wants - I think our goal has to be to eliminate poverty from India.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

The secretariat will play a pivotal role in decision-making above a certain level, where basic policies are involved, but below that, we will have to leave the implementation to whoever is in charge.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I find I have less time for everything. The assembly elections came so soon, and there is still so much work to be done.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

Indiraji should have been here today, speaking to you in her gentle, impassioned voice. One with Bharatmata's immortal spirit, she now shines as a lodestar not only for us but for all humanity.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

Civilizations are built by the ceaseless toil of a succession of generations. With softness and sloth, civilizations succumb. Let us beware of decadence.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We took such a beating on Bofors. As far as I know, no one from my government was involved.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

Even before V. P. Singh was shifted, the media was creating an impression that he was facing difficulties. This was totally incorrect.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I think what Punjab needs today is vigorous economic development and rebuilding of trust and social cohesion.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

There has to be a national consensus. We cannot legislate without overwhelming national consensus that religious and communal groups should be totally banned from politics.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We have been making changes continuously. You cannot expect everything to be perfect the minute it is made. Things change; they are dynamic as you progress. The requirements change. Demands change. So you change with that.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We are committed to the development of friendship and good neighbourly relations with Pakistan. I believe that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto shares this commitment.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

In every democracy, it is the people's will that is supreme. We should translate the intense yearning of the people of India and Pakistan for friendship into meaningful measures of cooperation in every walk of life.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

I would like to clarify that our opposition to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is not related to any consideration involving Pakistan. Our position on this important issue is consistent and principled. We are not ready to sign the NPT as it stands today because it is blatantly discriminatory in character.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

How shall we remember Mahatma Gandhi, that eternal pilgrim of freedom? Born of the very spirit of India, steeped in the tradition, the song, the legend of our ancient land - and yet he was revolutionary. Unique among revolutionaries, he marched for freedom, clad in the robe of truth, with non-violence for his staff.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

To Mahatma Gandhi, the key to India's progress was the development of its villages. In his unified vision, education, agriculture, village industry, social reform all came together to provide the basis for a vibrant rural society free from exploitation and linked to the urban centres as equals. Our planning incorporates this basic insight.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We cannot and will not rest until we have won true swaraj for the hungry and spiritually starving millions - until we have wiped out poverty from our land.


"
Rajiv Gandhi,"

We need a better strategy to achieve the national goal of a stable population, healthier and better educated.


"
Mohanlal,"

Life is a collage of events, really.


"
Mohanlal,"

There comes a turning point in the life of every person when he reflects on his journey and work and ponders on the next road to take. Is this the pinnacle, the ultimate? What next?


"
Mohanlal,"

Cinema is an art form, a result of dedication of a number of people.


"
Mohanlal,"

Friendship is accepting a person with all their qualities - good and bad.


"

I don't hope for anything. Not only in my professional life, but in my family life also. My total lifestyle is like that.

People want to see other's secrets and get a peek into their lives.

I believe that football can inspire youngsters to find the path of success in life.


"
Mohanlal,"

Destiny plays a very important role in my life.


"
Mohanlal,"

I have a shot a lot of movies in Dubai.


"
Mohanlal,"

People know I am not blind or have super strength, yet they believed in my characters in 'Oppam' and 'Pulimurugan.' It's that belief of the audience that is also my greatest strength. Once that is gone, I might have to shut up shop and look for another job.


"
Mohanlal,"

Being an actor doesn't mean that I can't react to what's happening around me.


"
Mohanlal,"

I acted in my first film while in my second year of degree college, in 1978.


"
Mohanlal,"

It's a great honour for me to be a part of a Kamal Haasan film.


"
Mohanlal,"

My first film was 'Thiranottam.' I cannot discount that film because I got initiated into films with it.


"
Mohanlal,"

Cinema has given me everything in life, and I will continue acting till the end.


"
Mohanlal,"

There is no big problem in the Malayalam industry. You shouldn't think of the #MeToo as a movement, actually. It is a fad, and it is turning into something of a fashion. Anything like that will have a lifespan for a bit.


"
Mohanlal,"

I studied, gained friends, became a father, faced the clipboard unexpectedly for the first time, earned some beautiful moments with family and buddies in Thiruvananthapuram.


"
Mohanlal,"

I liked the concept of 'Lucifer.'


"
Mohanlal,"

I know it's a craze in Bollywood to have six-pack abs, but here, it's not the abs or the biceps that make us feel or look macho. Down south, the moustache still works for us!


"
Mohanlal,"

TV has the most reach among the audience. Movies are watched only by those who like cinema.


"
Mohanlal,"

Every actor or director has their ups and downs.


"
Mohanlal,"

I do all my films happily, and I enjoy every moment of it.


"
Mohanlal,"

In developed countries, strong rules are in place to restrict sound pollution and curb its deadly effects. As law-abiding citizens with social responsibility, we should all come together against this unhealthy trend.


"
Mohanlal,"

There was a time when not many people had access to Malayalam films. So those who did have access went on to copy the films, add a few bits, and present it like it was their own.


"
Mohanlal,"

I own a couple of restaurants in places like Dubai and Sharjah.


"
Mohanlal,"

Kunjali Marakkar is one of the first naval commanders of Kerala. He was an expert at his craft.


"
Mohanlal,"

Many talented actors have come into this industry and, in spite of their best efforts, haven't been able to win over the audience.


"
Mohanlal,"

I have learned to take things as they come.


"
Mohanlal,"

All my films can't be like 'Narasimham.'


"
Mohanlal,"

I have seen 'A Wednesday,' and it is a wonderful film.


"
Mohanlal,"

Even in Hollywood, filmmakers are re-creating classics at regular intervals.


"
Mohanlal,"

I generally have confidence in my directors.


"
Mohanlal,"

I don't get bored at all while acting.


"
Mohanlal,"

In the Indian system of filmmaking, you don't plan well in advance, stick to a storyboard, or deliver only the scripted lines.


"
Mohanlal,"

Death can come at any time to anyone. Everybody is equal before death.


"
Mohanlal,"

I have been writing my blog for several years. Whenever I have written about pertinent subjects, no one has supported them. For instance, the stray dog menace. I cycle in the morning every day, and I am still scared of stray dog attacks.


"
Mohanlal,"

If you ask me whether I can direct, I can. In fact, I have shot several songs, scenes and stunts. When certain directors of my movies were not able to be there for some reason and had asked me to help out, I have directed. But to helm an entire movie is a different art altogether.


"
Mohanlal,"

Be it cinema or TV, I have always been interested in taking up challenging projects.


"
Mohanlal,"

'Oppam' is more of a director's movie, especially because I play a visually-challenged hero in it. The character doesn't have a perspective, and so cameras aren't placed like how they are usually done in other movies. The angles and the way the scenes are captured are different.


"
Mohanlal,"

You feel hurt when you hear things which you are supposed to have said, which you wouldn't even have given a thought to.


"
Mohanlal,"

When I was in school, I used to go to the Pangode army camp, a stone's throw away from where I was staying in Mudavanmugal in Poojapura, just to watch the army parade.


"
Mohanlal,"

I work, or spend much of my time with the same friends who were with me right from my first movie.


"
Mohanlal,"

The entertainment industry is humungous, and people have so many choices right now - they can watch web series, movies, stand-up comedies, and plays.


"
Mohanlal,"

I love to take some holidays. In fact, I am a guy who wants to take a break for at least 10 days after each movie.


"
Mohanlal,"

Films are not meant to be watched only by fans but by everyone. Fans are those who like what we do. When we do things that only they like, then we are becoming their fans.


"
Mohanlal,"

Once the director calls for action, we act; we stop when he says 'Cut.' It is sort of like meditation - unknowingly, you are moving out of yourself, becoming someone else. That is why I consider acting a form of meditation.


"
Mohanlal,"

The thing about movies is that till it goes on floors, it's just preparations for the film.


"
Mohanlal,"

Morality depends on individual freedom, and it requires some sense to know where to draw the line.


"
Mohanlal,"

Every actor, director, and producer want all their films to do well. So you choose the role carefully, listen to the script, and work hard. But there is no way of predicting whether it will be a hit or a flop.


"
Mohanlal,"

I was not the producer of 'Vaanaprastham' earlier. The first producers backed out when they became doubtful about the monetary benefits. I do not blame them. But as an actor, I wanted to make the film. So, I told Shaji sir that I would produce the film. It was only then we started shooting.


"
Mohanlal,"

I was into movies before my graduation results got out. In fact, I was on location of a movie when they came.


"
Mohanlal,"

India has a law. The political parties or the religious heads have no right to control that law.


"
Mohanlal,"

It's my right to write on what I feel about certain incidents, and it's your choice whether to read it or not.


"
Mohanlal,"

All my success belongs to those who have contributed in my pursuit of art, ranging from writers and directors to makeup artists, lighting crew, etc.


"
Mohanlal,"

Just like films, food is also a passion for me.


"
Mohanlal,"

Sometimes, you fall into a ditch without knowing it is there, without seeing it, but you try to come out of it. If you fall again, you will jump out again.


"
Mohanlal,"

I feel there is an unknown energy pushing me to do certain things in life.


"
Mohanlal,"

It's not enough that you act in a movie - if it has to work, the audience should like it.

Mohanlal,"

For me, every film is an interesting experience.

Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself, but talent instantly recognizes genius.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.

It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.

London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Where there is no imagination there is no horror.

We can't command our love, but we can our actions.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

For strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.

The lowest and vilest alleys of London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.

A man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.


"

Our ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

There is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

As a rule, said Holmes, the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

The most difficult crime to track is the one which is purposeless.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

To the man who loves art for its own sake, it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

From a drop of water a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

The ideal reasoner, he remarked, would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example.

Arthur Conan Doyle,"

Sir Walter, with his 61 years of life, although he never wrote a novel until he was over 40, had, fortunately for the world, a longer working career than most of his brethren.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?


"
Arthur Conan Doyle,"

You will, I am sure, agree with me that... if page 534 only finds us in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable.


"
James Madison,"

Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.

Philosophy is common sense with big words.


"
James Madison,"

I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.


"
James Madison,"

The truth is that all men having power ought to be mistrusted.


"
James Madison,"

The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.


"
James Madison,"

It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.


"
James Madison,"

The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.


"
James Madison,"

And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed, as every past one has done, in showing that religion and Government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.


"
James Madison,"

The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived.


"
James Madison,"

Wherever there is interest and power to do wrong, wrong will generally be done.


"
James Madison,"

A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained in arms, is the best most natural defense of a free country.


"
James Madison,"

What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?


"
James Madison,"

Let me recommend the best medicine in the world: a long journey, at a mild season, through a pleasant country, in easy stages.


"
James Madison,"

The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.


"
James Madison,"

A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce, or a tragedy, or perhaps both.


"
James Madison,"

Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise, every expanded prospect.


"
James Madison,"

As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed.


"
James Madison,"

It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad.


"
James Madison,"

In Republics, the great danger is, that the majority may not sufficiently respect the rights of the minority.


"
James Madison,"

A well-instructed people alone can be permanently a free people.


"
James Madison,"

A pure democracy is a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.


"
James Madison,"

The happy Union of these States is a wonder; their Constitution a miracle; their example the hope of Liberty throughout the world.


"
James Madison,"

In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.


"
James Madison,"

America was indebted to immigration for her settlement and prosperity. That part of America which had encouraged them most had advanced most rapidly in population, agriculture and the arts.


"
James Madison,"

The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.


"
James Madison,"

No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.


"
James Madison,"

The capacity of the female mind for studies of the highest order cannot be doubted, having been sufficiently illustrated by its works of genius, of erudition, and of science.

Americans have the right and advantage of being armed - unlike the citizens of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.


"
James Madison,"

We are right to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties.


"
James Madison,"

The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the state governments, in times of peace and security.


"
James Madison,"

A sincere and steadfast co-operation in promoting such a reconstruction of our political system as would provide for the permanent liberty and happiness of the United States.


"
James Madison,"

Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties, or his possessions.


"
James Madison,"

The Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.


"
James Madison,"

A man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them.


"
James Madison,"

The class of citizens who provide at once their own food and their own raiment, may be viewed as the most truly independent and happy.


"
James Madison,"

Despotism can only exist in darkness, and there are too many lights now in the political firmament to permit it to remain anywhere, as it has heretofore done, almost everywhere.


"
James Madison,"

To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.


"
James Madison,"

Of all the enemies of public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.


"
James Madison,"

There is no maxim, in my opinion, which is more liable to be misapplied, and which, therefore, more needs elucidation, than the current one, that the interest of the majority is the political standard of right and wrong.


"
James Madison,"

The executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.


"
James Madison,"

War should only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits.


"
James Madison,"

As a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.


"
James Madison,"

Each generation should be made to bear the burden of its own wars, instead of carrying them on, at the expense of other generations.

James Madison,"

Every nation whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of its wiser neighbors.


"
James Madison,"

Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Government.


"
James Madison,"

"
James Madison,"

To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.


"
James Madison,"

The number, the industry, and the morality of the priesthood, and the devotion of the people have been manifestly increased by the total separation of the church from the state.

"
James Madison,"

What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed?


"
James Madison,"

Whenever a youth is ascertained to possess talents meriting an education which his parents cannot afford, he should be carried forward at the public expense.


"
James Madison,"

Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.


"
James Madison,"

Commercial shackles are generally unjust, oppressive, and impolitic.


"
James Madison,"

War contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason.


"
James Madison,"

If we are to take for the criterion of truth the majority of suffrages, they ought to be gotten from those philosophic and patriotic citizens who cultivate their reason.

Jack Ma,"

Never give up. Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine.


"
Jack Ma,"

I call Alibaba '1,001 mistakes.' We expanded too fast, and then in the dot-com bubble, we had to have layoffs. By 2002, we had only enough cash to survive for 18 months. We had a lot of free members using our site, and we didn't know how we'd make money. So we developed a product for China exporters to meet U.S. buyers online. This model saved us.


"
Jack Ma,"

You should learn from your competitor, but never copy. Copy and you die.


"
Jack Ma,"

Spending money is much more difficult than making money.


"
Jack Ma,"

I don't want to be liked. I want to be respected.


"
Jack Ma,"

We should keep on going along the path of globalization. Globalization is good... when trade stops, war comes.


"
Jack Ma,"

When I am myself, I am happy and have a good result.


"
Jack Ma,"

There are big problems that change the world. If we are working together, that will make us understand each other, appreciate each other, help each other.


"
Jack Ma,"

Help young people. Help small guys. Because small guys will be big. Young people will have the seeds you bury in their minds, and when they grow up, they will change the world.


"
Jack Ma,"

The lessons I learned from the dark days at Alibaba are that you've got to make your team have value, innovation, and vision. Also, if you don't give up, you still have a chance. And, when you are small, you have to be very focused and rely on your brain, not your strength.


"
Jack Ma,"

My vision is to build an e-commerce ecosystem that allows consumers and businesses to do all aspects of business online.


"
Jack Ma,"

Trust the young people; trust this generation's innovation. They're making things, changing innovation every day. And all the consumers are the same: they want new things, they want cheap things, they want good things, they want unique things. If we can create these kind of things for consumers, they will come.


"
Jack Ma,"

The very important thing you should have is patience.


"
Jack Ma,"

The world needs new leadership, but the new leadership is about working together.


"
Jack Ma,"

I don't think I'm a workaholic. Every weekend, I invite my colleagues and friends to my home to play cards. And people, my neighbors, are always surprised because I live on the second floor apartment, and there are usually 40 pairs of shoes in front of my gate, and people play cards inside and play chess. We have a lot of fun.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm not a tech guy. I'm looking at the technology with the eyes of my customers, normal people's eyes.


"
Jack Ma,"

I don't want people in China to have deep pockets but shallow minds.


"
Jack Ma,"

A trade war would be a disaster for the world. It's very easy to slip into a trade war.


"
Jack Ma,"

I even don't dare to watch our stock price, because this is what other people think who you are. I dare not watch it. I think, let the market take care of themselves; we should take care of the business.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm coming to this world not to work. I want to come to this world to enjoy my life. I don't want to die in my office. I want to die on the beaches.


"
Jack Ma,"

My job is making money, helping other people make money. I am spending money, trying to make sure more people get rich, because you cannot spend a lot of money, right? So my job is spending money, helping others. This is a headache.


"
Jack Ma,"

Trade is a communication of cultures and values.


"
Jack Ma,"

A startup for entrepreneurs is like a baby, and I have five babies so far - experienced father.


"
Jack Ma,"

I know nothing about technology.


"
Jack Ma,"

A peace talk is always difficult, always complicated.


"
Jack Ma,"

There's an examination for young people to go to university. I failed it three times. I failed a lot. So I applied to 30 different jobs and got rejected. I went for a job with the police; they said, 'You're no good.' I even went to KFC when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job. Twenty-three were accepted.


"
Jack Ma,"

Today the financial market is no good, but the money is there.


"
Jack Ma,"

The most important thing is to make the technology inclusive - make the world change. Next, pay attention to those people who are 30 years old, because those are the internet generation. They will change the world; they are the builders of the world.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm a normal guy.


"
Jack Ma,"

The difference between Amazon and us is Amazon is more like an empire - everything they control themselves, buy and sell.


"
Jack Ma,"

The name Jack was given by an American tourist.


"
Jack Ma,"

As a company, we have to be very transparent. We are in a business very related to finance, and I want this company to last long, and I want this company to be audited by everyone.


"
Jack Ma,"

EBay is a great company. There are a lot of good assets and good customers, and the U.S. people love it.


"
Jack Ma,"

When we started the e-commerce, nobody believed that China would have e-commerce because people believed in 'guang-shi,' face-to-face, and all kinds of network in traditional ways. There's no trust system in China.


"
Jack Ma,"

Before I left China, I was educated that China was the richest, happiest country in the world. So when I arrived Australia, I thought, 'Oh my God, everything is different from what I was told.' Since then, I started to think differently.


"
Jack Ma,"

You American people worry too much about the China economy. Every time you think China is a problem, we get better, but when you have a high expectation for China, China is always a problem.


"
Jack Ma,"

I don't care about revenues.


"
Jack Ma,"

Every time there's an election, people start to criticize China.


"
Jack Ma,"

I try to make myself happy, no, because I know that if I'm not happy, my colleagues are not happy and my shareholders are not happy and my customers are not happy.


"
Jack Ma,"

I think U.S. and Chinese businesses need a common language and dialogue.


"
Jack Ma,"

China's government is so strong on investment, so strong on exporting, but they're too weak on domestic consumption.


"
Jack Ma,"

My job is to help more people have jobs.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm humble 'cause I think many years ago people say, 'Well, Alibaba's terrible company'. And I know we were not that terrible. We're pretty good; we're better than people thought. But today, when people have a high expectation on you, and I start to worry and nervous because we are not good yet.


"
Jack Ma,"

I want people to learn what democracy means.


"
Jack Ma,"

I think globalization is a great thing. And now a lot of people complain about globalization; a lot of people don't like, you know, the globalize of the concept, the idea of the results. I think the globalization is a great idea and to create a lot of jobs.


"
Jack Ma,"

Chinese people, young people, they don't go shopping a lot in department stores. All department store guys hate me. They say business is bad because of Jack.


"
Jack Ma,"

I'm just a purist. What is important in my life is that I can do something that can influence many people and influence China's development. When I am myself, I am relaxed and happy and have a good result.


"
Jack Ma,"

The American multinational companies made millions and millions of dollars from globalization.


"
Jack Ma,"

Nobody wanted to believe Jack Ma.


"
Jack Ma,"

If you're doing business, not that simple to only buy. You have to create something. You have to create something that never exist for the future.


"
Jack Ma,"

What a publication can do is to help people get a clearer picture without jumping to any rash conclusion. I'm very happy that the 'Post' can take the responsibility to report on China in a broader and deeper way. I believe the 'Post' must be fair to our readers. We should let our readers see China from more angles and perspectives.


"
Jack Ma,"

China is still the fastest growing economy in the world, but we need to learn how to use money in a better way, and it's about quality, not quantity.


"
Jack Ma,"

On privacy issues, it's just like hundreds of years ago when people said, 'I would rather put my money under my pillow than in a bank.' But today, banks know how to protect money much better than you do. Today, we may not have the answers to privacy issues, but I believe our young people will come up with the solutions.


"
Jack Ma,"

The big businesses are less willing to take risks. I talked to some young people in Hong Kong, and they said they are lost. Young people indeed have fewer opportunities than before. But is it true that there are no more opportunities for them? No!


"
Jack Ma,"

People say, 'Well you know the economy's bad, so China consumption will be low. No, totally different. You Americans love to spend tomorrow's money, and other people's money maybe... We Chinese love to save money.


"
Jack Ma,"

If you want to invest in us, we believe customer number one, employee number two, shareholder number three. If they don't want to buy that, that's fine. If they regret, they can sell us.


"
Jack Ma,"

I think Yahoo is a great company, with great assets.


"
Jack Ma,"

Alibaba is an ecosystem that helps small business to grow.


"
Jack Ma,"

When I was 12 years old, I went to swim in a lake, and I almost died in that lake because the water was too deep - much deeper than I thought.

The welfare of the people in particular has always been the alibi of tyrants.

A guilty conscience needs to confess. A work of art is a confession.

The need to be right is the sign of a vulgar mind.

Albert Camus,"

Ah, mon cher, for anyone who is alone, without God and without a master, the weight of days is dreadful.

"
Alexander the Great,"

Oh! Most miserable wretch that I am! Why have I not learnt how to swim?


"
Alexander the Great,"

I had rather excel others in the knowledge of what is excellent, than in the extent of my power and dominion.


"
Alexander the Great,"

For my own part, I would rather excel in knowledge of the highest secrets of philosophy than in arms.


"
Alexander the Great,"

How happy had it been for me had I been slain in the battle. It had been far more noble to have died the victim of the enemy than fall a sacrifice to the rage of my friends.


"
Alexander the Great,"

So far as I am concerned, I could not be accused of having set eyes, or having wished to set eyes, upon Darius' wife: on the contrary, I have refused even to listen to those who spoke to me of her beauty.


"
Alexander the Great,"

I wish that the Indians believed me a god, for upon the report of an enemy's valor oftentimes depends the success of a battle, and false reports have many times done as great things as true courage and resolution.

Shall I, that have destroyed my Preservers, return home?


"
Alexander the Great,"

"
Alexander the Great,"

His father is governor of Media, and though he has the greatest command given him of all the rest of my generals, he still covetously desires more, and my being without issue spurs him on to this wicked design. But Philotas takes wrong measures.


"
Alexander the Great,"

If we turn our backs of the Scythians who have provoked us, how shamefully shall we march against the revolted Bactrians; but if we pass Tanais and make the Scythians feel, by dear experience, that we are invincible, not in Asia only, it is not to be doubted but that Europe itself, as well as Asia, will come within the bounds of our conquests.

"
Angelina Jolie,"

I need more sex, OK? Before I die I wanna taste everyone in the world.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I do believe in the old saying, 'What does not kill you makes you stronger.' Our experiences, good and bad, make us who we are. By overcoming difficulties, we gain strength and maturity.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Without pain, there would be no suffering, without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes. To make it right, pain and suffering is the key to all windows, without it, there is no way of life.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Our diversity is our strength. What a dull and pointless life it would be if everyone was the same.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

If you don't get out of the box you've been raised in, you won't understand how much bigger the world is.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I like someone who is a little crazy but coming from a good place. I think scars are sexy because it means you made a mistake that led to a mess.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Where ever I am I always find myself looking out the window wishing I was somewhere else.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I've been reckless, but I'm not a rebel without a cause.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

All women do have a different sense of sexuality, or sense of fun, or sense of like what's sexy or cool or tough.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Make bold choices and make mistakes. It's all those things that add up to the person you become.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I'm happy being myself, which I've never been before. I always hid in other people, or tried to find myself through the characters, or live out their lives, but I didn't have those things in mine.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

We have a choice about how we take what happens to us in our life and whether or not we allow it to turn us. We can become consumed by hate and darkness, or we're able to regain our humanity somehow, or come to terms with things and learn something about ourselves.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I don't see myself as beautiful, because I can see a lot of flaws. People have really odd opinions. They tell me I'm skinny, as if that's supposed to make me happy.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

The truth is I love being alive. And I love feeling free. So if I can't have those things then I feel like a caged animal and I'd rather not be in a cage. I'd rather be dead. And it's real simple. And I think it's not that uncommon.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Every woman is different when they go through menopause, and... I didn't know emotionally how I would feel.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

When I get logical, and I don't trust my instincts - that's when I get in trouble.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I always play women I would date.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I try to lead by example, being conscious of others and being responsible.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I don't believe in guilt; I believe in living on impulse as long as you never intentionally hurt another person. And don't judge people in your life. I think you should live completely free.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

We care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

When other little girls wanted to be ballet dancers I kind of wanted to be a vampire.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

What nourishes me also destroys me.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

There's something about death that is comforting. The thought that you could die tomorrow frees you to appreciate your life now.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I love to put on lotion. Sometimes I'll watch TV and go into a lotion trance for an hour. I try to find brands that don't taste bad in case anyone wants to taste me.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I have so much in my life. I want to be of value to the world.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I never thought I'd have children; I never thought I'd be in love, I never thought I'd meet the right person. Having come from a broken home - you kind of accept that certain things feel like a fairy tale, and you just don't look for them.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Real food, I've found, is actually better than dieting.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I am a strong believer that without justice, there is no peace. No lasting peace, anyway.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Without Cambodia, I may never have become a mother. Part of my heart is and will always be in this country. And part of this country is always with me: Maddox.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Most women in my family start to get sick and start dying in their 40s, and I am going to be very happy to become 50 and 60. I love getting older.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I didn't really want to live, so anything that was an investment in time made me angry... but also I just felt sad. When the hopelessness is hurting you, it's the fixtures and fittings that finish you off.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I've realized that being happy is a choice. You never want to rub anybody the wrong way or not be fun to be around, but you have to be happy. When I get logical and I don't trust my instincts - Thats when I get in trouble.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

The side of fairytales I don't like is that they always have happy endings, that there's just good and evil, and things are perfect. But life is a little more complicated, and that's what I try to teach my kids.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Ever since I dated a woman, I know what it is to grab a curve on a woman's body. Skinny's not fine when the lights are low.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Honestly, I like everything, boyish girls, girlish boys, the heavy and the skinny.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I never like being touched, ever. People used to say I held my breath when they were hugging me. I still do.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women. It's like people see Hackers and they send me offers to play tough women with guns, the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top. I'd like to play strong women who are also very feminine.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

If you have enough people sitting around telling you you're wonderful, then you start believing you're fabulous, then someone tells you you stink and you believe that too!


"
Angelina Jolie,"

If every choice you make comes from an honest place, you're solid, and nothing anybody can say about you can rock you or change your opinion.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I'm being smart about my choices, and I'm putting my family first, and I'm in charge of my life and my health. I think that's what makes a woman complete.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Brad and I have never wanted our kids to be actors, but we also want them to be around film and be a part of Mommy and Daddy's life and for it not to be kept from them, either. We just want them to have a good, healthy relationship with it.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I'm not somebody that thinks about destiny and fate, but I don't walk away from it when something unfolds.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I never felt settled or calm. You can't really commit to life when you feel that.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

Homework's hard. Especially math. My kids joke with me. They tell me they have homework. I say, 'Okay.' And then I sit down and they say, 'It's math.' 'No! Not math! English, history, anything!'


"
Angelina Jolie,"

First and foremost comes my family and my life with Brad. We have so much joy in raising our children and teaching them about the world that nothing really compares to that.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

War is so complex; human nature is so complex. There's no filmmaker who has ever figured it out perfectly.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I've learned that we all change constantly. It's rare to find that person who is growing with you in the same way at the same time, who encourages you to grow.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

If you're going to spend two years of your life on something, it has to matter to you; you have to be passionate about it.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

If I make a fool of myself, who cares? I'm not frightened by anyone's perception of me.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I like to hide behind the characters I play. Despite the public perception, I am a very private person who has a hard time with the fame thing.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

There's nothing I have to hide or defend. I'm gonna live my life. And there are times when people wanna try to attack me, and I don't know why, but they will. And that's okay.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I think if you make a good movie, people walk away arguing.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I was the punk outsider who nobody messed with. I was fearless. At 16, I graduated and moved out.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

The 'Maddox Jolie-Pitt' Foundation's work is inspired by our children and their connections to particular countries.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I grew up as this very carefree, happy kid then things turned darker for me. Maybe it was because I saw that the world wasn't as happy a place as I had hoped it would be for me.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold them in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I like to work with artists from around the world. There are so many new inspiring filmmakers.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

I love Brad in every state.


"
Angelina Jolie,"

They are resilient children, but they are children, and as much as they need help to understand the hard truths in life, they also need what we all need - protection and love.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I am a simple man who comes from a village, and villagers like us speak our mind. Now, in the process, if unknowingly my words came across as disrespectful or insulting, then I am deeply sorry. I don't want to hurt anyone.


"
Arijit Singh,"

At times, when I reach my saturation point, I go to some random place and throw my phone away.


"
Arijit Singh,"

In reality shows, you have to perform once and prove yourself, and after that, it is a process to prove yourself every day.


"
Arijit Singh,"

If someone is trying to skip the struggle - which is the creative job - our machines today, the technology that we have, can help the person, but it is only momentary. On the other hand, if you are creative, you have the skill, and you are hardworking, technology can only make you superior.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I still don't have a car. I still travel by public transport. I take autos to travel to and fro for recordings.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I like to read Bengali novels and short stories. I am not that fond of reading English books, as I don't have a connect with it.


"
Arijit Singh,"

When my voice breaks, it recovers automatically. I don't do anything special to maintain my voice. I have a natural voice and don't have to take care of it.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I like to compose, but only for myself. I write my own lyrics and compose the music around them.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I have one favourite song, and that's 'Aayat' from 'Bajirao Mastani.'


"
Arijit Singh,"

Singing for a documentary that benefits the underprivileged remains one of my biggest dreams.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I wanted to be someone who wanted to produce music, and here I am, and I'm happy about it.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I'm bad in front of the camera. However, if someone gave me a small role in a film with two dialogues and one scene, I'd do it.


"
Arijit Singh,"

My grandma's into music. My mom is a singer. Even my sister is a much better singer than I am. So you could say music runs in the family.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I've done a couple of songs which are not up to the mark. So, mentally, I've set a goal that I should be more dynamic and try and push myself as much as I can.


"
Arijit Singh,"

Reality shows give a great platform to young singers, but kids shouldn't be exposed to showbiz at a very young age.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I am songwriter. I do compose the music of songs that I write in Bengali. But I've never thought of composing for a film. That's a different art altogether.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I would not understand when people will tell me that 'Tum hi ho' has got more than 1 million views on YouTube. I was like, 'How does it make a difference?' Later, I would go to YouTube and see songs of Rihanna, Enrique etc. and would see their hits. Then I came to know the importance. Nowadays, you can judge from these sites how big is a sing.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I've been singing one kind of genre for a long time but have always tried to push to new auras about picking new songs or the same kind of genre but trying to sing it differently, treating it differently.


"
Arijit Singh,"

When I'm not singing, I'm a lot of persons: I'm a producer. I'm a badminton player. I'm a writer. I'm a movie freak. I'm a documentary maker.


"
Arijit Singh,"

When I joined the music scene, a lot of big-ticket singers were not getting good work... It was a lean phase.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I have always wanted to become a musician and a singer.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I've always tried to avoid electronic music in India because whatever songs I got in the genre I didn't really enjoy singing them - I didn't like the arrangements.


"
Arijit Singh,"

I have always liked to live my life in a quiet and peaceful manner. I used to lead my life that way. But the rise in social media has certainly affected me. Now I am always noticed.


"
Arijit Singh,"

More people are asking me to come and sing for them, so obviously I am getting more work. But apart from singing, I have been parallely programming and producing music tracks and assisting music directors. That is my bread and butter, which is how I survived in Mumbai. Now I can't leave it.


"
Arijit Singh,"

Apart from work, whatever pending things I have to do, I do it in Murshidabad.

Aristotle,"

A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion. Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side.


"
Aristotle,"

Even when laws have been written down, they ought not always to remain unaltered.

"
Arthur Ashe,"

One important key to success is self-confidence. An important key to self-confidence is preparation.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

The ideal attitude is to be physically loose and mentally tight.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life.

A wise person decides slowly but abides by these decisions.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

You've got to get to the stage in life where going for it is more important than winning or losing.

Arthur Ashe,"

I keep sailing on in this middle passage. I am sailing into the wind and the dark. But I am doing my best to keep my boat steady and my sails full.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

Clothes and manners do not make the man; but when he is made, they greatly improve his appearance.

You learn about equality in history and civics, but you find out life is not really like that.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

There is a syndrome in sports called 'paralysis by analysis.'


"
Arthur Ashe,"

Do not feel sorry for me if I am gone.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

I accepted the face that as much as I want to lead others, and love to be around other people, in some essential way, I am something of a loner.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

Let me put it this way: I think Republicans tend to keep the ball in play, Democrats go for broke.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

I don't want to be remembered for my tennis accomplishments.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

When we were together, I loved you deeply and you gave me so much happiness I can never repay you.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

We must believe in the power of education. We must respect just laws. We must love ourselves, our old and or young, our women as well as our men.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

If you're paid before you walk on the court, what's the point in playing as if your life depended on it?


"
Arthur Ashe,"

I have always drawn strength from being close to home.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

When bright young minds can't afford college, America pays the price.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

I don't care who you are, you're going to choke in certain matches. You get to a point where your legs don't move and you can't take a deep breath. You start to hit the ball about a yard wide, instead of inches.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

Later, I discovered there was a lot of work to being good in tennis.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

I guess I started too early because I just thought it was something fun to do.


"
Arthur Ashe,"

I may not be walking with you all the way, or even much of the way, as I walk with you now.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.

Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see.

Just remember, once you're over the hill you begin to pick up speed.


"

The doctor sees all the weakness of mankind; the lawyer all the wickedness, the theologian all the stupidity.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

A man can be himself only so long as he is alone, and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom, for it is only when he is alone that he is really free.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Each day is a little life: every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Money is human happiness in the abstract; he, then, who is no longer capable of enjoying human happiness in the concrete devotes himself utterly to money.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

A man can do what he wants, but not want what he wants.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Great men are like eagles, and build their nest on some lofty solitude.

Satisfaction consists in freedom from pain, which is the positive element of life.

Arthur Schopenhauer,"

The two enemies of human happiness are pain and boredom.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

The greatest of follies is to sacrifice health for any other kind of happiness.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

The discovery of truth is prevented more effectively, not by the false appearance things present and which mislead into error, not directly by weakness of the reasoning powers, but by preconceived opinion, by prejudice.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Every parting gives a foretaste of death, every reunion a hint of the resurrection.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Change alone is eternal, perpetual, immortal.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Buying books would be a good thing if one could also buy the time to read them in: but as a rule the purchase of books is mistaken for the appropriation of their contents.

Politeness is to human nature what warmth is to wax.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

It is a clear gain to sacrifice pleasure in order to avoid pain.

Hatred is an affair of the heart; contempt that of the head.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

The more unintelligent a man is, the less mysterious existence seems to him.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Great minds are related to the brief span of time during which they live as great buildings are to a little square in which they stand: you cannot see them in all their magnitude because you are standing too close to them.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

The first forty years of life give us the text; the next thirty supply the commentary on it.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Treat a work of art like a prince. Let it speak to you first.

"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Friends and acquaintances are the surest passport to fortune.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Opinion is like a pendulum and obeys the same law. If it goes past the centre of gravity on one side, it must go a like distance on the other; and it is only after a certain time that it finds the true point at which it can remain at rest.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

We can come to look upon the deaths of our enemies with as much regret as we feel for those of our friends, namely, when we miss their existence as witnesses to our success.

With people of limited ability modesty is merely honesty. But with those who possess great talent it is hypocrisy.

Every person takes the limits of their own field of vision for the limits of the world.

Almost all of our sorrows spring out of our relations with other people.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

We forfeit three-quarters of ourselves in order to be like other people.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

They tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

The difficulty is to try and teach the multitude that something can be true and untrue at the same time.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Reading is equivalent to thinking with someone else's head instead of with one's own.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

A man's face as a rule says more, and more interesting things, than his mouth, for it is a compendium of everything his mouth will ever say, in that it is the monogram of all this man's thoughts and aspirations.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

There is no doubt that life is given us, not to be enjoyed, but to be overcome; to be got over.

"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

The wise have always said the same things, and fools, who are the majority have always done just the opposite.

Sleep is the interest we have to pay on the capital which is called in at death; and the higher the rate of interest and the more regularly it is paid, the further the date of redemption is postponed.

It is in the treatment of trifles that a person shows what they are.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Every possession and every happiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time, and may therefore be demanded back the next hour.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

There is no absurdity so palpable but that it may be firmly planted in the human head if you only begin to inculcate it before the age of five, by constantly repeating it with an air of great solemnity.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

In our monogamous part of the world, to marry means to halve one's rights and double one's duties.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Because people have no thoughts to deal in, they deal cards, and try and win one another's money. Idiots!


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

Rascals are always sociable, more's the pity! and the chief sign that a man has any nobility in his character is the little pleasure he takes in others' company.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

For an author to write as he speaks is just as reprehensible as the opposite fault, to speak as he writes; for this gives a pedantic effect to what he says, and at the same time makes him hardly intelligible.


"
Arthur Schopenhauer,"

In the sphere of thought, absurdity and perversity remain the masters of the world, and their dominion is suspended only for brief periods.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Cultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

I like the religion that teaches liberty, equality and fraternity.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Life should be great rather than long.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

The relationship between husband and wife should be one of closest friends.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

A great man is different from an eminent one in that he is ready to be the servant of the society.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

We are Indians, firstly and lastly.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Men are mortal. So are ideas. An idea needs propagation as much as a plant needs watering. Otherwise both will wither and die.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Man's life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

However good a Constitution may be, if those who are implementing it are not good, it will prove to be bad. However bad a Constitution may be, if those implementing it are good, it will prove to be good.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

History shows that where ethics and economics come in conflict, victory is always with economics. Vested interests have never been known to have willingly divested themselves unless there was sufficient force to compel them.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Law and order are the medicine of the body politic and when the body politic gets sick, medicine must be administered.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Every man who repeats the dogma of Mill that one country is no fit to rule another country must admit that one class is not fit to rule another class.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Caste is not a physical object like a wall of bricks or a line of barbed wire which prevents the Hindus from co-mingling and which has, therefore, to be pulled down. Caste is a notion; it is a state of the mind.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Democracy is not merely a form of government. It is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience. It is essentially an attitude of respect and reverence towards fellow men.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

So long as you do not achieve social liberty, whatever freedom is provided by the law is of no avail to you.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

What are we having this liberty for? We are having this liberty in order to reform our social system, which is full of inequality, discrimination and other things, which conflict with our fundamental rights.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Religion and slavery are incompatible.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

The sovereignty of scriptures of all religions must come to an end if we want to have a united integrated modern India.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Religion must mainly be a matter of principles only. It cannot be a matter of rules. The moment it degenerates into rules, it ceases to be a religion, as it kills responsibility which is an essence of the true religious act.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

In Hinduism, conscience, reason and independent thinking have no scope for development.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words: liberty, equality and fraternity. Let no one, however, say that I have borrowed by philosophy from the French Revolution. I have not. My philosophy has roots in religion and not in political science. I have derived them from the teachings of my Master, the Buddha.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Political tyranny is nothing compared to the social tyranny and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man than a politician who defies Government.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

There is one taboo against meat-eating. It divides Hindus into vegetarians and flesh eaters. There is another taboo which is against beef eating. It divides Hindus into those who eat cow's flesh and those who do not.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

That the caste system must be abolished if the Hindu society is to be reconstructed on the basis of equality, goes without saying. Untouchability has its roots in the caste system. They cannot expect the Brahmins to rise in revolt against the caste system. Also we cannot rely upon the non-Brahmins and ask them to fight our battle.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Some people think that religion is not essential to society. I do not hold this view. I consider the foundation of religion to be essential to the life and practices of a society.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

I solemnly assure you that I will not die as a Hindu.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

An ideal society should be mobile, should be full of channels for conveying a change taking place in one part to other parts. In an ideal society, there should be many interests consciously communicated and shared.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Caste may be bad. Caste may lead to conduct so gross as to be called man's inhumanity to man. All the same, it must be recognized that the Hindus observe Caste not because they are inhuman or wrong-headed. They observe Caste because they are deeply religious.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

To my mind, there is no doubt that this Gandhi age is the dark age of India. It is an age in which people, instead of looking for their ideals in the future, are returning to antiquity.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

One can quite understand vegetarianism. One can quite understand meat-eating. But it is difficult to understand why a person who is a flesh-eater should object to one kind of flesh, namely cow's flesh. This is an anomaly which call for explanation.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

A people and their religion must be judged by social standards based on social ethics. No other standard would have any meaning if religion is held to be necessary good for the well-being of the people.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Indeed, the Muslims have all the social evils of the Hindus and something more. That something more is the compulsory system of purdah for Muslim women. These burka women walking in the streets is one of the most hideous sights one can witness in India.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Indians today are governed by two different ideologies. Their political ideal set in the preamble of the Constitution affirms a life of liberty, equality and fraternity. Their social ideal embodied in their religion denies them.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

That the object of the Brahmins in giving up beef-eating was to snatch away from the Buddhist Bhikshus the supremacy they had acquired is evidenced by the adoption of vegetarianism by Brahmins.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Why is it that a large majority of Hindus do not inter-dine and do not inter-marry? Why is it that your cause is not popular? There can be only one answer to this question, and it is that inter-dining and inter-marriage are repugnant to the beliefs and dogmas which the Hindus regard as sacred.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Some men say that they should be satisfied with the abolition of untouchability only, leaving the caste system alone. The aim of abolition of untouchability alone without trying to abolish the inequalities inherent in the caste system is a rather low aim.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

For a successful revolution it is not enough that there is discontent. What is required is a profound and thorough conviction of the justice, necessity and importance of political and social rights.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

Generally speaking, the Smritikars never care to explain the why and the how of their dogmas.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

The reason why Broken Men only became Untouchables was because in addition to being Buddhists, they retained their habit of beef-eating, which gave additional ground for offence to the Brahmins to carry their new-found love and reverence to the cow to its logical conclusion.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

People are not wrong in observing Caste. In my view, what is wrong is their religion, which has inculcated this notion of Caste. If this is correct, then obviously the enemy, you must grapple with is not the people who observe Caste, but the Shastras which teach them this religion of Caste.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

The Touchables, whether they are vegetarians or flesh-eaters, are united in their objection to eat cow's flesh. As against them stand the Untouchables, who eat cow's flesh without compunction and as a matter of course and habit.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

The food habits of the different classes of Hindus have been as fixed and stratified as their cults. Just as Hindus can be classified on their basis of their cults, so also they can be classified on the basis of their habits of food.


"
B. R. Ambedkar,"

No Hindu community, however low, will touch cow's flesh. On the other hand, there is no community which is really an Untouchable community which has not something to do with the dead cow. Some eat her flesh, some remove the skin, some manufacture articles out of her skin and bones.


"
Barack Obama,"

Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.


"
Barack Obama,"

If you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you'll make progress.


"
Barack Obama,"

Why can't I just eat my waffle?

Barack Obama,"

The future rewards those who press on. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I'm going to press on.


"
Barack Obama,"

Money is not the only answer, but it makes a difference.


"
Barack Obama,"

If the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.


"
Barack Obama,"

There is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and latino America and asian America - there's the United States of America.


"
Barack Obama,"

We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense.


"
Barack Obama,"

Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.


"
Barack Obama,"

Now, as a nation, we don't promise equal outcomes, but we were founded on the idea everybody should have an equal opportunity to succeed. No matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you can make it. That's an essential promise of America. Where you start should not determine where you end up.


"
Barack Obama,"

My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too.


"
Barack Obama,"

I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage. But when you start playing around with constitutions, just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person, it just seems to me that's not what America's about. Usually, our constitutions expand liberties, they don't contract them.


"
Barack Obama,"

We proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges.


"
Barack Obama,"

Understand, our police officers put their lives on the line for us every single day. They've got a tough job to do to maintain public safety and hold accountable those who break the law.


"
Barack Obama,"

In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?


"
Barack Obama,"

I'm a warrior for the middle class.


"
Barack Obama,"

I've got two daughters. 9 years old and 6 years old. I am going to teach them first of all about values and morals. But if they make a mistake, I don't want them punished with a baby.


"
Barack Obama,"

The thing about hip-hop today is it's smart, it's insightful. The way they can communicate a complex message in a very short space is remarkable.


"
Barack Obama,"

I think same sex couples should be able to get married.


"
Barack Obama,"

It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, family leave, health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label.


"
Barack Obama,"

We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.


"
Barack Obama,"

That's the good thing about being president, I can do whatever I want.


"
Barack Obama,"

I mean, I do think at a certain point you've made enough money.


"
Barack Obama,"

It took a lot of blood, sweat and tears to get to where we are today, but we have just begun. Today we begin in earnest the work of making sure that the world we leave our children is just a little bit better than the one we inhabit today.


"
Barack Obama,"

What Washington needs is adult supervision.


"
Barack Obama,"

We need to internalize this idea of excellence. Not many folks spend a lot of time trying to be excellent.


"
Barack Obama,"

We can't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times... and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK. That's not leadership. That's not going to happen.


"
Barack Obama,"

We want everybody to act like adults, quit playing games, realize that it's not just my way or the highway.


"
Barack Obama,"

I think when you spread the wealth around it's good for everybody.


"
Barack Obama,"

In a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power - including strong and principled diplomacy.

Barack Obama,"

I've got a pen and I've got a phone - and I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.


"
Barack Obama,"

The United States is not, and never will be, at war with Islam.


"
Barack Obama,"

It's not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.


"
Barack Obama,"

It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington. To help build a new foundation for the 21st century, we need to reform our government so that it is more efficient, more transparent, and more creative. That will demand new thinking and a new sense of responsibility for every dollar that is spent.


"
Barack Obama,"

It's not enough to train today's workforce. We also have to prepare tomorrow's workforce by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education.


"
Barack Obama,"

We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.


"
Barack Obama,"

A good compromise, a good piece of legislation, is like a good sentence; or a good piece of music. Everybody can recognize it. They say, 'Huh. It works. It makes sense.'

Barack Obama,"

I just miss - I miss being anonymous.


"
Barack Obama,"

Issues are never simple. One thing I'm proud of is that very rarely will you hear me simplify the issues.


"
Barack Obama,"

Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.


"
Barack Obama,"

We all knew this. We all knew that it would take more time than any of us want to dig ourselves out of this hole created by this economic crisis.


"
Barack Obama,"

We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.


"
Barack Obama,"

This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet. Let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands.


"
Barack Obama,"

If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help... Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.


"
Barack Obama,"

No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well, you do the math. I refuse to go along with that. And as long as I'm President, I never will.

Barack Obama,"

I just want to go through Central Park and watch folks passing by. Spend the whole day watching people. I miss that.


"
Barack Obama,"

We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated.

We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing in our students and our schools. We must make sure that people who have the grades, the desire and the will, but not the money, can still get the best education possible.

The thing that alarms me is that there are so many clergymen who say that the so-called 'new morality' is all right.

Democracy don't rule the world, You'd better get that in your head; This world is ruled by violence, But I guess that's better left unsaid.

"
Bob Dylan,"

The land created me. I'm wild and lonesome. Even as I travel the cities, I'm more at home in the vacant lots.


"
Bob Dylan,"

Being noticed can be a burden. Jesus got himself crucified because he got himself noticed. So I disappear a lot.


"
Bob Dylan,"

I don't think the human mind can comprehend the past and the future. They are both just illusions that can manipulate you into thinking theres some kind of change.


"
Bob Dylan,"

Inspiration is hard to come by. You have to take it where you find it.


"

A poem is a naked person... Some people say that I am a poet.

Just because you like my stuff doesn't mean I owe you anything.


"
Bob Dylan,"

You hear a lot about God these days: God, the beneficent; God, the all-great; God, the Almighty; God, the most powerful; God, the giver of life; God, the creator of death. I mean, we're hearing about God all the time, so we better learn how to deal with it. But if we know anything about God, God is arbitrary.

What good are fans? You can't eat applause for breakfast. You can't sleep with it.


"
Bob Dylan,"

If I wasn't Bob Dylan, I'd probably think that Bob Dylan has a lot of answers myself.

Bob Dylan,"

You can't do something forever.


"
Bob Dylan,"

I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings. And I've never been too impressed.

"
Bob Dylan,"

In ceremonies of the horsemen, even the pawn must hold a grudge.

Bruce Lee,"

Man, the living creature, the creating individual, is always more important than any established style or system.


"
Carl Jung,"

A particularly beautiful woman is a source of terror. As a rule, a beautiful woman is a terrible disappointment.

"
Carl Jung,"

Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people.

Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.

In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.

Carl Jung,"

Through pride we are ever deceiving ourselves. But deep down below the surface of the average conscience a still, small voice says to us, something is out of tune.


"
Carl Jung,"

There is no such thing as a pure introvert or extrovert. Such a person would be in the lunatic asylum.


"
Carl Jung,"

The most intense conflicts, if overcome, leave behind a sense of security and calm that is not easily disturbed. It is just these intense conflicts and their conflagration which are needed to produce valuable and lasting results.


"
Carl Jung,"

The collective unconscious consists of the sum of the instincts and their correlates, the archetypes. Just as everybody possesses instincts, so he also possesses a stock of archetypal images.

"
Carl Jung,"

If there is anything that we wish to change in the child, we should first examine it and see whether it is not something that could better be changed in ourselves.


"
Carl Jung,"

We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect. The judgement of the intellect is only part of the truth.


"
Carl Jung,"

Mistakes are, after all, the foundations of truth, and if a man does not know what a thing is, it is at least an increase in knowledge if he knows what it is not.


"
Carl Jung,"

The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.


"
Carl Jung,"

The man who promises everything is sure to fulfil nothing, and everyone who promises too much is in danger of using evil means in order to carry out his promises, and is already on the road to perdition.


"
Carl Jung,"

It is a fact that cannot be denied: the wickedness of others becomes our own wickedness because it kindles something evil in our own hearts.


"
Carl Jung,"

We shall probably get nearest to the truth if we think of the conscious and personal psyche as resting upon the broad basis of an inherited and universal psychic disposition which is as such unconscious, and that our personal psyche bears the same relation to the collective psyche as the individual to society.


"
Carl Jung,"

I have treated many hundreds of patients. Among those in the second half of life - that is to say, over 35 - there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life.


"
Carl Jung,"

There is no birth of consciousness without pain.


"
Carl Jung,"

A human being would certainly not grow to be seventy or eighty years old if this longevity had no meaning for the species. The afternoon of human life must also have a significance of its own and cannot be merely a pitiful appendage to life's morning.


"
Carl Jung,"

We deem those happy who from the experience of life have learnt to bear its ills without being overcome by them.


"
Carl Jung,"

Masses are always breeding grounds of psychic epidemics.


"
Carl Jung,"

The debt we owe to the play of imagination is incalculable.

"
Carl Jung,"

Who has fully realized that history is not contained in thick books but lives in our very blood?

Man's task is to become conscious of the contents that press upward from the unconscious.


"
Carl Jung,"

Nobody, as long as he moves about among the chaotic currents of life, is without trouble.


"
Carl Jung,"

Dreams are the guiding words of the soul. Why should I henceforth not love my dreams and not make their riddling images into objects of my daily consideration?


"
Carl Jung,"

A 'scream' is always just that - a noise and not music.


"
Carl Jung,"

In my case Pilgrim's Progress consisted in my having to climb down a thousand ladders until I could reach out my hand to the little clod of earth that I am.


"
Carl Jung,"

The Christ-symbol is of the greatest importance for psychology in so far as it is perhaps the most highly developed and differentiated symbol of the self, apart from the figure of the Buddha.


"
Carl Jung,"

The Christian missionary may preach the gospel to the poor naked heathen, but the spiritual heathen who populate Europe have as yet heard nothing of Christianity.


"
Carl Jung,"

Shrinking away from death is something unhealthy and abnormal which robs the second half of life of its purpose.


"

Education is the best friend. An educated person is respected everywhere. Education beats the beauty and the youth.


"
Chanakya,"

A good wife is one who serves her husband in the morning like a mother does, loves him in the day like a sister does and pleases him like a prostitute in the night.

A person should not be too honest. Straight trees are cut first and honest people are screwed first.

Before you start some work, always ask yourself three questions - Why am I doing it, What the results might be and Will I be successful. Only when you think deeply and find satisfactory answers to these questions, go ahead.


"
Chanakya,"

Even if a snake is not poisonous, it should pretend to be venomous.

"
Chanakya,"

He who is overly attached to his family members experiences fear and sorrow, for the root of all grief is attachment. Thus one should discard attachment to be happy.

He who lives in our mind is near though he may actually be far away; but he who is not in our heart is far though he may really be nearby.

The life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which neither covers its rear end, nor protects it from the bites of insects.


"
Chanakya,"

Books are as useful to a stupid person as a mirror is useful to a blind person.


"
Chanakya,"

It is better to die than to preserve this life by incurring disgrace. The loss of life causes but a moment's grief, but disgrace brings grief every day of one's life.


"
Chanakya,"

There is poison in the fang of the serpent, in the mouth of the fly and in the sting of a scorpion; but the wicked man is saturated with it.


"

One whose knowledge is confined to books and whose wealth is in the possession of others, can use neither his knowledge nor wealth when the need for them arises.


"
Chanakya,"

The serpent, the king, the tiger, the stinging wasp, the small child, the dog owned by other people, and the fool: these seven ought not to be awakened from sleep.

Chanakya,"

Test a servant while in the discharge of his duty, a relative in difficulty, a friend in adversity, and a wife in misfortune.


"
Chanakya,"

The happiness and peace attained by those satisfied by the nectar of spiritual tranquillity is not attained by greedy persons restlessly moving here and there.


"
Chanakya,"

We should not fret for what is past, nor should we be anxious about the future; men of discernment deal only with the present moment.


"
Chanakya,"

As long as your body is healthy and under control and death is distant, try to save your soul; when death is immanent what can you do?


"
Chanakya,"

O wise man! Give your wealth only to the worthy and never to others. The water of the sea received by the clouds is always sweet.


"
Chanakya,"

Do not reveal what you have thought upon doing, but by wise council keep it secret being determined to carry it into execution.

"
Chanakya,"

Charles R. Swindoll,"

Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

We cannot change our past. We can not change the fact that people act in a certain way. We can not change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

We are all faced with a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised as impossible situations.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Let's face it, friends make life a lot more fun.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

The difference between something good and something great is attention to detail.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Attitude is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than what people do or say. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

A teardrop on earth summons the King of heaven.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life. The longer I live the more convinced I become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

The remarkable thing is, we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Prejudice is a learned trait. You're not born prejudiced; you're taught it.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

The secret of living a life of excellence is merely a matter of thinking thoughts of excellence. Really, it's a matter of programming our minds with the kind of information that will set us free.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

A family is a place where principles are hammered and honed on the anvil of everyday living.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

We need discernment in what we see and what we hear and what we believe.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

We can't solve modern problems by going back in time. Retreating to the safety of the familiar is an understandable response, but God has called us to a life of faith. And faith requires us to face the unknown while trusting Him completely.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

The swift wind of compromise is a lot more devastating than the sudden jolt of misfortune.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

The world has changed and it's going to keep changing, but God never changes; so we are safe when we cling to Him.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

One of the worst things you can give to your people is someone you're not.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

You and I are, by birth, by nature, and by choice, inwardly depraved, which is to say that we are entirely corrupt. That's not to say that we have no good in us; we do. However, anything good in us has been tainted with evil. It touches everything. Without the redeeming power of Christ we cannot halt our own moral slide.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

There is nothing more fearful for the average person in our society than to stand before a group of people and speak.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

When I think of vision, I have in mind the ability to see above and beyond the majority.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I let people see the cracks in my life. We can't be phony. We've got to keep it real.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Alleged 'impossibilities' are opportunities for our capacities to be stretched.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

The wonderful thing about God is he knows what we need to persuade us.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

When you have vision it affects your attitude. Your attitude is optimistic rather than pessimistic.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

When you have a sense of calling, whether it's to be a musician, soloist, artist, in one of the technical fields, or a plumber, there is something deep and enriching when you realize it isn't just a casual choice, it's a divine calling. It's not limited to vocational Christian service by any means.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I am often the brunt of my own humor.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I know of nothing more valuable, when it comes to the all-important virtue of authenticity, than simply being who you are.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Sometimes I wake up before dawn, and I love sitting up in the middle of the bed with all the lights off, pitch-black dark, and talking to the Father, with no interruptions and nothing that reminds me that there's anything in life but me and Him.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I have no interest in returning to yesteryear. I love the conveniences and delights of today's time. I wouldn't go back if I could.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

As far back as I can remember, my mother would have me down by the bed at night with her, praying. I can still hear her voice calling my name to God and telling him that she wanted me to follow him in whatever he called me to do.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Nothing is more bothersome to me than retiring. Weird things happen when you disengage; first you get negative, then you start telling people about your latest surgeries, and eventually you lose touch. I want to stay in touch.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Because God gave you your makeup and superintended every moment of your past, including all the hardship, pain, and struggles, He wants to use your words in a unique manner. No one else can speak through your vocal cords, and, equally important, no one else has your story.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I'm here today to warn you: I want you to watch out for the adversary. Guard yourself from any spirit of entitlement. Restrain any and all subtle temptation to gain attention or to find ways to promote yourself.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

We want a crowd to make us feel important and liked. But why is getting a crowd our focus? Jesus never suggested that crowds were the goal. He never addresses getting your church to grow. Never.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I'm not against screens, or new songs, or innovation. I just don't like the gimmicks. I want to know when worship is over that that leader's sole purpose was to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

When you are giving people the gospel, you are giving them something to believe, and you have to set the stage for that. You don't just drive up and dump the truck and drive off.

Charles R. Swindoll,"

One of my great goals in life is to live long enough to where I am in the pulpit, preaching my heart out, and I die on the spot, my chin hits the pulpit - boom! - and I'm down and out. What a way to die!


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

It's the most exciting thing to watch God work when I've asked him about something, to listen to him and watch him work. It's like this friendship, and it just grows and grows and grows and grows.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

It is easy for Christians to have the false impression that once we have established a relationship with Christ, which we believe sets us right with God, the problems of life will somehow scoot away or they will slowly be removed from our lives.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

When a church is spending more of its budget on media than shepherding, something is out of whack. We have gotten things twisted around.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I think it is important to begin with a statement in your speech that grabs the attention of the audience. I try to make my opening line 15 words or less.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I am a preacher. I'm involved in many other things, but, mainly, I preach. And I love it!


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

There is plenty of television. There are plenty of talk shows. There are plenty of comedians. But there is not plenty of worship of the true and living God.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

Not every Christian finds it easy to believe.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

'We really shouldn't look like a church.' I've heard that so much I want to vomit. 'Why?' I ask. 'Do you want your bank to look like a bank? Do you want your doctor's office to look like a doctor's office, or would you prefer your doctor to dress like a clown?'


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

If I ever wrote a book on preaching, it would contain three words: Preach the Word. Get rid of all the other stuff that gets you sidetracked; preach the Word.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

I believe firmly in God's control in life.


"
Charles R. Swindoll,"

While I was raised around churches and had gotten to know a few preachers fairly well, the thought never entered my head that I would one day stand and deliver. Not only was I not interested, I lived with a major struggle: I stuttered.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Wisdom is the right use of knowledge. To know is not to be wise. Many men know a great deal, and are all the greater fools for it. There is no fool so great a fool as a knowing fool. But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows, but only empties today of its strength.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

By perseverance the snail reached the ark.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

A good character is the best tombstone. Those who loved you and were helped by you will remember you when forget-me-nots have withered. Carve your name on hearts, not on marble.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Sincerity makes the very least person to be of more value than the most talented hypocrite.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

The Lord gets his best soldiers out of the highlands of affliction.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

My evidence that I am saved does not lie in the fact that I preach, or that I do this or that. All my hope lies in this: that Jesus Christ came to save sinners. I am a sinner, I trust Him, then He came to save me, and I am saved.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Trials teach us what we are; they dig up the soil, and let us see what we are made of.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Revenge, lust, ambition, pride, and self-will are too often exalted as the gods of man's idolatry; while holiness, peace, contentment, and humility are viewed as unworthy of a serious thought.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

In the same way the sun never grows weary of shining, nor a stream of flowing, it is God's nature to keep His promises. Therefore, go immediately to His throne and say, 'Do as You promised.'


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

I would go to the deeps a hundred times to cheer a downcast spirit. It is good for me to have been afflicted, that I might know how to speak a word in season to one that is weary.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

True prayer is neither a mere mental exercise nor a vocal performance. It is far deeper than that - it is spiritual transaction with the Creator of Heaven and Earth.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

The greatest enemy to human souls is the self-righteous spirit which makes men look to themselves for salvation.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Beware of no man more than of yourself; we carry our worst enemies within us.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Grow in the root of all grace, which is faith. Believe God's promises more firmly than ever. Allow your faith to increase in its fullness, firmness, and simplicity.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Of two evils, choose neither.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

The first fresh hour of every morning should be dedicated to the Lord, whose mercy gladdens it with golden light.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Free will carried many a soul to hell, but never a soul to heaven.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

We are in a wrong state of mind if we are not in a thankful state of mind.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Do I live as carelessly and worldly as unbelievers while professing to be a follower of Jesus? If so, I am exposing Christianity to ridicule and leading people to speak evil of the holy name by which I am called.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

If Christ has died for me, ungodly as I am, without strength as I am, then I cannot live in sin any longer, but must arouse myself to love and serve Him who has redeemed me.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Think not that humility is weakness; it shall supply the marrow of strength to thy bones. Stoop and conquer; bow thyself and become invincible.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

How sweet it is to learn the Savior's love when nobody else loves us! When friends flee, what a blessed thing it is to see that the Savior does not forsake us but still keeps us and holds us fast and clings to us and will not let us go!


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

There is a power in God's gospel beyond all description.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

'You are no saint,' says the devil. Well, if I am not, I am a sinner, and Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. Sink or swim, I go to Him; other hope, I have none.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

I believe that nothing happens apart from divine determination and decree. We shall never be able to escape from the doctrine of divine predestination - the doctrine that God has foreordained certain people unto eternal life.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

If you believe in prayer at all, expect God to hear you. If you do not expect, you will not have. God will not hear you unless you believe He will hear you; but if you believe He will, He will be as good as your faith.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

You might not always get what you want, but you always get what you expect.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

A daily portion is really all we need. We do not need tomorrow's supply, for that day has not yet dawned, and its needs are still unborn.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Many men owe the grandeur of their lives to their tremendous difficulties.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Humility is to make a right estimate of one's self.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

I think that is a better thing than thanksgiving: thanks-living. How is this to be done? By a general cheerfulness of manner, by an obedience to the command of Him by whose mercy we live, by a perpetual, constant delighting of ourselves in the Lord, and by a submission of our desires to His will.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

All the goodness I have within me is totally from the Lord alone. When I sin, it is from me and is done on my own, but when I act righteously, it is wholly and completely of God.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Saving faith is an immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, resting upon Him alone, for justification, sanctification, and eternal life by virtue of God's grace.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

You will never exaggerate when you speak good things of God. It is not possible to do so. Try, dear brethren, and boast in the Lord.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Purposes, plans, and achievements of men may all disappear like yon cloud upon the mountain's summit; but, like the mountain itself, the things which are of God shall stand fast for ever and ever.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

It is not well to make great changes in old age.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

May we have communion with God in the secret of our hearts, and find Him to be to us as a little sanctuary.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

All our actions, as well as our thoughts and words, should praise Him who always blesses us.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

In prayer, we stand where angels bow with veiled faces. There, even there, the cherubim and seraphim adore before that selfsame throne to which our prayers ascend. And shall we come there with stunted requests and narrow, contracted faith?


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Conversion is a change of masters. Will we not do as much for our new master, the Lord Jesus, as we did once for our old tyrant lusts?


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

You and I, the people of God, have permission to come before the throne of Heaven at any time we will, and we are encouraged to come there with great boldness.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Sometimes, if you begin to sing in a halfhearted mood, you can sing yourself up the ladder. Singing will often make the heart rise.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Giving is true having.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Think of what you are, you Christians. You are God's children; you are joint heirs with Christ. The 'many mansions' are for you; the palms and harps of the glorified are for you. You have a share in all that Christ has and is and shall be.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

The goose that lays the golden eggs likes to lay where there are eggs already.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Young men, trust God, and make the future bright with blessing. Old men, trust God, and magnify him for all the mercies of the past.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

We do not pray to God to instruct Him as to what He should do; neither for a moment must we presume to dictate the method of the divine working.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Fill the earth with your songs of gratitude.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

A man will speedily sit down and sympathize with a friend's griefs, but if he sees him honored and esteemed, he is apt to regard him as a rival and does not so readily rejoice with him. This ought not to be; without effort, we ought to be happy in our brother's happiness.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

There are some people who need to wear a label round their necks to show that they are Christians at all, or else we might mistake them for sinners, their actions are so like those of the ungodly.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Nothing reflects so much honor on a workman as a trial of his work and its endurance of it. So it is with God. It honors Him when His saints preserve their integrity.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

A vigorous temper is not altogether an evil. Men who are easy as an old shoe are generally of little worth.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

The roaring thunder of the law and the fear of the terror of judgment are both used to bring us to Christ, but the final victory culminating in our salvation is won through God's loving-kindness.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

After many years of great mercy, after tasting of the powers of the world to come, we still are so weak, so foolish; but, oh! when we get away from self to God, there all is truth and purity and holiness, and our heart finds peace, wisdom, completeness, delight, joy, victory.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

O God, we praise Thee for keeping us till this day, and for the full assurance that Thou wilt never let us go.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

Have we been going up and down in business, and are those round about us as yet unaware of our Christian character? Have we never spoken to them the Word of Life? Lord, arouse us to a deep concern for all with whom we come in contact from day to day.


"
Charles Spurgeon,"

I groan daily under a body of sin and corruption. Oh for the time when I shall drop this flesh, and be free from sin!


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

A day without laughter is a day wasted.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Life could be wonderful if people would leave you alone.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Nothing is permanent in this wicked world - not even our troubles.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain, and play with it!


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

A tramp, a gentleman, a poet, a dreamer, a lonely fellow, always hopeful of romance and adventure.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

A man's true character comes out when he's drunk.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Man as an individual is a genius. But men in the mass form the headless monster, a great, brutish idiot that goes where prodded.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Failure is unimportant. It takes courage to make a fool of yourself.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

In the end, everything is a gag.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Remember, you can always stoop and pick up nothing.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I suppose that's one of the ironies of life doing the wrong thing at the right moment.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

What do you want a meaning for? Life is a desire, not a meaning.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Words are cheap. The biggest thing you can say is 'elephant'.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Despair is a narcotic. It lulls the mind into indifference.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I am at peace with God. My conflict is with Man.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

We think too much and feel too little.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Laughter is the tonic, the relief, the surcease for pain.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I remain just one thing, and one thing only, and that is a clown. It places me on a far higher plane than any politician.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

This is a ruthless world and one must be ruthless to cope with it.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

The saddest thing I can imagine is to get used to luxury.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

All I need to make a comedy is a park, a policeman and a pretty girl.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I went into the business for the money, and the art grew out of it. If people are disillusioned by that remark, I can't help it. It's the truth.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I do not have much patience with a thing of beauty that must be explained to be understood. If it does need additional interpretation by someone other than the creator, then I question whether it has fulfilled its purpose.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I thought I would dress in baggy pants, big shoes, a cane and a derby hat. everything a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I'd sooner be called a successful crook than a destitute monarch.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the make-up made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked onto the stage he was fully born.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I am for people. I can't help it.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

To help a friend in need is easy, but to give him your time is not always opportune.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

That is why, no matter how desperate the predicament is, I am always very much in earnest about clutching my cane, straightening my derby hat and fixing my tie, even though I have just landed on my head.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

We might as well die as to go on living like this.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Movies are a fad. Audiences really want to see live actors on a stage.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I don't believe that the public knows what it wants; this is the conclusion that I have drawn from my career.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Why should poetry have to make sense?


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

I have no further use for America. I wouldn't go back there if Jesus Christ was President.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

Actors search for rejection. If they don't get it they reject themselves.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

All my pictures are built around the idea of getting in trouble and so giving me the chance to be desperately serious in my attempt to appear as a normal little gentleman.


"
Charlie Chaplin,"

The glamour of it all! New York! America!


"
Che Guevara,"

The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall.


"
Che Guevara,"

If you tremble with indignation at every injustice, then you are a comrade of mine.


"
Che Guevara,"

The true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.


"
Che Guevara,"

Silence is argument carried out by other means.


"
Che Guevara,"

We cannot be sure of having something to live for unless we are willing to die for it.


"
Che Guevara,"

Above all, always be capable of feeling deeply any injustice committed against anyone, anywhere in the world. This is the most beautiful quality in a revolutionary.


"
Che Guevara,"

I know you are here to kill me. Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man.


"
Che Guevara,"

I have a wish. It as a fear as well - that in my end will be my beginning.


"
Che Guevara,"

Cruel leaders are replaced only to have new leaders turn cruel.


"
Che Guevara,"

The only passion that guides me is for the truth... I look at everything from this point of view.


"
Che Guevara,"

Remember that the revolution is what is important, and each one of us, alone, is worth nothing.


"
Che Guevara,"

Passion is needed for any great work, and for the revolution, passion and audacity are required in big doses.


"
Che Guevara,"

Whenever death may surprise us, let it be welcome if our battle cry has reached even one receptive ear and another hand reaches out to take up our arms.


"
Che Guevara,"

Study hard so that you can master technology, which allows us to master nature.


"
Che Guevara,"

It is important to emphasize that guerrilla warfare is a war of the masses, a war of the people. The guerrilla band is an armed nucleus, the fighting vanguard of the people. It draws its great force from the mass of the people themselves.


"
Che Guevara,"

How easy it is to govern when one follows a system of consulting the will of the people and one holds as the only norm all the actions which contribute to the well being of the people.


"
Che Guevara,"

Many will call me an adventurer - and that I am, only one of a different sort: one of those who risks his skin to prove his platitudes.


"
Che Guevara,"

I am one of those people who believes that the solution to the world's problems is to be found behind the Iron Curtain.


"
Che Guevara,"

I could become very rich in Guatemala but by the low method of ratifying my title, opening a clinic, and specialising in allergies. To do that would be the most horrible betrayal of the two 'I's' struggling inside me: the socialist and the traveller.


"
Che Guevara,"

The peasant must always be helped technically, economically, morally and culturally. The guerrilla fighter will be a sort of guiding angel who has fallen into the zone, helping the poor always and bothering the rich as little as possible in the first phases of the war.


"
Che Guevara,"

The guerrilla fighters should be required to go to bed and get up at fixed hours. Games that have no social function and that hurt the morale of the troops and the consumption of alcoholic drinks should both be prohibited.


"
Che Guevara,"

I had a project for my life which involved 10 years of wandering, then some years of medical studies and, if any time was left, the great adventure of physics.


"
Che Guevara,"

I would probably have more in common with a whale than with a bourgeois married couple employed at worthy institutions that I would wipe from the face of the earth if it was given to me to do so.


"
Che Guevara,"

It is unnecessary to say that Fidel Castro possesses the high qualities of a fighter and statesman: our path, our struggle, and our triumph we owed to his vision.


"
Che Guevara,"

A political event was that I met Fidel Castro, the Cuban revolutionary. He is a young, intelligent guy, very sure of himself and extraordinarily audacious; I think we hit it off well.


"
Colin Powell,"

A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.


"
Colin Powell,"

There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.


"
Colin Powell,"

If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude.


"
Colin Powell,"

Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.


"
Colin Powell,"

Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.


"
Colin Powell,"

Success is the result of perfection, hard work, learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence.


"
Colin Powell,"

Great leaders are almost always great simplifiers, who can cut through argument, debate and doubt, to offer a solution everybody can understand.


"
Colin Powell,"

Get mad, then get over it.


"
Colin Powell,"

Diplomacy is listening to what the other guy needs. Preserving your own position, but listening to the other guy. You have to develop relationships with other people so when the tough times come, you can work together.


"
Colin Powell,"

Don't let your ego get too close to your position, so that if your position gets shot down, your ego doesn't go with it.


"
Colin Powell,"

Surround yourself with people who take their work seriously, but not themselves, those who work hard and play hard.


"
Colin Powell,"

Bad news isn't wine. It doesn't improve with age.


"
Colin Powell,"

It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.


"
Colin Powell,"

Fit no stereotypes. Don't chase the latest management fads. The situation dictates which approach best accomplishes the team's mission.


"
Colin Powell,"

Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.


"
Colin Powell,"

Experts often possess more data than judgment.


"
Colin Powell,"

The commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is wrong, unless proved otherwise.


"
Colin Powell,"

You're not just voting for an individual, in my judgment, you're voting for an agenda. You're voting for a platform. You're voting for a political philosophy.


"
Colin Powell,"

As I have done in every election since I started voting so many years ago, I always like to take my time and examine the two candidates, see not only the two candidates but the policies they will bring in, the people they will bring in, who they might appoint to the Supreme Court, and look at the whole range of issues before making a decision.


"
Colin Powell,"

Never neglect details. When everyone's mind is dulled or distracted the leader must be doubly vigilant.


"
Colin Powell,"

Never let your ego get so close to your position that when your position goes, your ego goes with it.


"
Colin Powell,"

If a leader doesn't convey passion and intensity then there will be no passion and intensity within the organization and they'll start to fall down and get depressed.


"
Colin Powell,"

90 percent of my time is spent on 10 percent of the world.


"
Colin Powell,"

Don't be afraid to challenge the pros, even in their own backyard.


"
Colin Powell,"

No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.


"
Colin Powell,"

You don't know what you can get away with until you try.


"
Colin Powell,"

Russia isn't going to start a war. They can't afford it. I think Mr. Putin can be dealt with if we stop screaming at him. You can work with the guy. You just have to know who he is.


"
Colin Powell,"

The healthiest competition occurs when average people win by putting above average effort.


"
Colin Powell,"

In other words, don't expect to always be great. Disappointments, failures and setbacks are a normal part of the lifecycle of a unit or a company and what the leader has to do is constantly be up and say 'we have a problem, let's go and get it'.


"
Colin Powell,"

I think whether you're having setbacks or not, the role of a leader is to always display a winning attitude.


"
Colin Powell,"

Organization charts and fancy titles count for next to nothing.


"
Colin Powell,"

Trump is a national disgrace and an international pariah.


"
Colin Powell,"

Don't bother people for help without first trying to solve the problem yourself.


"
Colin Powell,"

Giving back involves a certain amount of giving up.


"
Colin Powell,"

Children need to get a high-quality education, avoid violence and the criminal-justice system, and gain jobs. But they deserve more. We want them to learn not only reading and math but fairness, caring, self-respect, family commitment, and civic duty.


"
Colin Powell,"

Drones are just another weapon, and they turn out to be a very effective weapon that puts no American troops at risk, and I don't see why we shouldn't use them against identified enemy targets.


"
Colin Powell,"

Today I can declare my hope and declare it from the bottom of my heart that we will eventually see the time when that number of nuclear weapons is down to zero and the world is a much better place.


"
Colin Powell,"

Some of the generals are saying, 'We're making progress. We are clearing an area.' But you really don't defeat the Taliban by clearing an area. They move.


"
Colin Powell,"

The chief condition on which, life, health and vigor depend on, is action. It is by action that an organism develops its faculties, increases its energy, and attains the fulfillment of its destiny.


"
Colin Powell,"

The only bipartisanship you ever see is when they finally sign a bill and everybody says, 'Gee, isn't that wonderful?'


"
Colin Powell,"

Economy's got to get moving, we've got to get the unemployment rate down. That may be the defining issue of the campaign.


"
Colin Powell,"

The Army will take its lessons learned. They're excellent at looking into themselves and reflecting on what did we do right, what did we do wrong.


"
Colin Powell,"

War should be the politics of last resort. And when we go to war, we should have a purpose that our people understand and support.


"
Colin Powell,"

When you decide to get involved in a military operation in a place like Syria, you've got to be prepared, as we learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, to become the government, and I'm not sure any country, either the United States or I don't hear of anyone else, who's willing to take on that responsibility.


"
Colin Powell,"

It was the Congress that imposed 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' it was certainly my position, my recommendation to get us out of an even worse outcome that could have occurred.


"
Colin Powell,"

There's not going to be a World War III, because there is no one to have World War III with.


"
Colin Powell,"

Have fun in your command. Don't always run at a breakneck pace. Take leave when you've earned it, spend time with your families.


"
Colin Powell,"

We have practiced diplomacy since the very beginning of the nation. Sometimes it has not worked, and we've had to go to war. I always believe you should try to find peace and reconciliation before conflict. That has been the approach I've taken.


"
Colin Powell,"

What we have to find is the right level of regulation of our financial system so that it has the incentive to invest in things, but at the same time, it is sufficiently regulated so it can't get in the kind of trouble that we have seen in the past and we have seen recently.


"
Colin Powell,"

But just as they did in Philadelphia when they were writing the constitution, sooner or later, you've got to compromise. You've got to start making the compromises that arrive at a consensus and move the country forward.


"
Colin Powell,"

Throughout my career, I learned plenty about war on the battlefield, but I learned even more about the importance of finding peace. And that is what the State Department and U.S.A.I.D. do: prevent the wars that we can avoid so that we fight only the ones we must.


"
Colin Powell,"

You should see what our Founding Fathers used to say to each other and in the early part of our nation. But what they were able to do, especially in Philadelphia in 1787, four months, they argued about what a House should be, what a Senate should be, the power of the president, the Congress, the Supreme Court. And they had to deal with slavery.


"
Colin Powell,"

I don't know that there is much the United States can do except work with the international community.


"
Colin Powell,"

Engineering didn't take to me. And what saved me and kept me in college was I ran into ROTC cadets who were in a fraternity called The Pershing Rifles. And I found my place. I found discipline. I found structure. I found people that were like me and I liked.


"
Colin Powell,"

The purposes of the United States should not be doubted. The Security Council resolutions will be enforced - the just demands of peace and security will be met - or action will be unavoidable. And a regime that has lost its legitimacy will also lose its power.


"
Colin Powell,"

Politics is not bean bags. It's serious, tough stuff.


"
Colin Powell,"

Standing in support of children is something we should all be able to get behind, regardless of party affiliation.


"
Colin Powell,"

There are lots of countries that are having these kinds of internal civil wars in other parts of the world and nobody is talking about intervening.


"
Colin Powell,"

Wouldn't it be great if we could look forward to a whole world in which no child will be left behind?


"
Colin Powell,"

Our diplomacy and development budget is not just about reducing spending and finding efficiencies. We need a frank conversation about what we stand for as that 'shining city on a hill.' And that conversation begins by acknowledging that we can't do it on the cheap.

Life is anything but predictable.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

Attitude and enthusiasm play a big part in my life. I get excited about the things that inspire me. I also believe in laughing and having a good time.

Check your ego at the door. The ego can be the great success inhibitor. It can kill opportunities, and it can kill success.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

The single most powerful thing I can be is to be myself.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I like to use the hard times in the past to motivate me today.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I'll never, ever be full. I'll always be hungry. Obviously, I'm not talking about food. Growing up, I had nothing for such a long time. Someone told me a long time ago, and I've never forgotten it, 'Once you've ever been hungry, really, really hungry, then you'll never, ever be full.'

With drive and a bit of talent, you can move mountains. I know. I've done it.

"
Dwayne Johnson,"

For me, training is my meditation, my yoga, hiking, biking all rolled into one. Wake up early in the morning, generally around 4 o'clock, and I'll do my cardio on an empty stomach. Stretch, have a big breakfast, and then I'll go train.

Dwayne Johnson,"

The one thing that I keep learning over and over again is that I don't know nothing. I mean, that's my life lesson.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

By the time I was 23 years old, I had multiple arrests.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I can eat two large pizzas and a tray of brownies in one sitting. I'm not sharing that. We can get another one, but I ain't sharing.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I grew up where, when a door closed, a window didn't open. The only thing I had was cracks. I'd do everything to get through those cracks - scratch, claw, bite, push, bleed. Now the opportunity is here. The door is wide open, and it's as big as a garage.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I want to be a man who is truthful and who won't let pride get in the way of my ripping myself open to my partner and saying, 'Here I am. This is me.' I feel there's something powerful when a man reaches a point in his life when he can be completely vulnerable.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I've learned never to say never.


"

There are definitely people who disagree with certain creative decisions you make. Pleasing everyone is pretty hard.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

The men I idolized built their bodies and became somebody - like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger - and I thought, 'That can be me.' So I started working out. The funny thing is I didn't realize back then that I was having a defining moment.


"

My reputation precedes me now.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

The successful men I admired all built their bodies.


"

As we all know, sequels can be tricky.

"
Dwayne Johnson,"

The one thing I couldn't identify with was the blue cowboy outfit he put on.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I was brought up as an only child, and we were very close. But when I was 14, we got evicted. We came home to a padlock, and I looked up at my mom and she was crying, and there was nothing to do.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

My philosophy is, it's always very rewarding when you can make an audience laugh. I don't mind making fun of myself. I like self-deprecating comedy. But I'd like you to laugh with me occasionally, too.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I'm very low-key. I don't really blend in, so it's difficult to go out in public. I like to do things that are kind of quiet, whether it's a dinner at my house or a restaurant, or a movie night at home.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I think that always makes it fun, trying to create a heroic character and putting your own twist on it and injecting your own personality into it.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I have an immense amount of respect for acting. I've always loved movies and was always fascinated by movie-making. But to become an actor, I wanted to commit myself.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

Barack Obama did tell me that I was one of Michelle Obama's favorite actors.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

When I was a kid, I loved Elvis, and Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. But I had no connection to Hollywood - and being a movie star was such a far-fetched idea, growing up in Hawaii.

"
Dwayne Johnson,"

It is no surprise that animation is Hollywood's most successful and innovative genre.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

One of the skills I had to learn and become proficient in is kissing a man. I had never kissed a man. Will Smith did it in his movies, so did Jake Gyllenhaal, and I figured it was my time. So it was me and Steve Carell - fantastic.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

Mickey Rourke's character in 'The Wrestler' - that was my dad, that was my uncles, that was so many members of my family. It was the only thing they knew. And then they would end up wrestling for a hundred bucks, go to autograph signings for two hundred bucks.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I knew credibility would come only in time and through earnest performances.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

Ain't nothing like a good cry.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

If you tell me there's something I can't do, I'll want to do it even more. Especially when it comes to entertaining.

Dwayne Johnson,"

I absolutely believed when I was young because the Tooth Fairy was always good to me. The Tooth Fairy generally left me a dollar or two dollars and, as a kid, that was a lot of money.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

Come on, you can't name a truck after a chick.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

My mom cleaned toilets for a long time, and she'd seen a lot of terrible things, but she was still the strength of our family. And there are women like that all across the country - all around the world - who show that type of fortitude.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I used to get into a lot of fights.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I've been fortunate to have had the life I had prior to Hollywood. I wasn't starving; I was going to eat the next day.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

I was born to play Hercules. I have loved and honored the mythology over the years - since I was a kid. When I first broke into Hollywood, 'Hercules' was one of the movies that I - not chased, because I didn't have the power to chase anything - but always had in the back of my mind.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

In the '60s and '70s and early '80s, the trainers would grind you, and eventually they would break something - they would break an ankle in ways that it would heal. It was just the way of the business, to ensure that you learned respect for wrestling.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

Wrestling is intimate. You can reach out and touch the wrestlers.


"
Dwayne Johnson,"

As an athlete, you'd better laugh at yourself when you slip in the mud.


"

When you are offended at any man's fault, turn to yourself and study your own failings. Then you will forget your anger.

Imagine for yourself a character, a model personality, whose example you determine to follow, in private as well as in public.

The essence of philosophy is that a man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things.


"
Epictetus,"

Freedom is not procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired, but by controlling the desire.


"
Epictetus,"

To accuse others for one's own misfortunes is a sign of want of education. To accuse oneself shows that one's education has begun. To accuse neither oneself nor others shows that one's education is complete.


"
Epictetus,"

Never in any case say I have lost such a thing, but I have returned it. Is your child dead? It is a return. Is your wife dead? It is a return. Are you deprived of your estate? Is not this also a return?

Difficulties are things that show a person what they are.

Once we have a war there is only one thing to do. It must be won. For defeat brings worse things than any that can ever happen in war.


"
Ernest Hemingway,"

When writing a novel a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature.

"
Ernest Hemingway,"

The shortest answer is doing the thing.


"

"
Ernest Hemingway,"

About morals, I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after.

I learned never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it.

"
Ernest Hemingway,"

Cowardice... is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend functioning of the imagination.


"
Ernest Hemingway,"

You see, I am trying in all my stories to get the feeling of the actual life across - not to just depict life - or criticize it - but to actually make it alive. So that when you have read something by me, you actually experience the thing. You can't do this without putting in the bad and the ugly as well as what is beautiful.

Ernest Hemingway,"

Why should anybody be interested in some old man who was a failure?


"
Ernest Hemingway,"

For a long time now I have tried simply to write the best I can. Sometimes I have good luck and write better than I can.


"
Ernest Hemingway,"

When I have an idea, I turn down the flame, as if it were a little alcohol stove, as low as it will go. Then it explodes and that is my idea.


"

Live your life as though your every act were to become a universal law.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Always recognize that human individuals are ends, and do not use them as means to your end.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Happiness is not an ideal of reason, but of imagination.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Seek not the favor of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means. But seek the testimony of few; and number not voices, but weigh them.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

By a lie, a man... annihilates his dignity as a man.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Immaturity is the incapacity to use one's intelligence without the guidance of another.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

It is beyond a doubt that all our knowledge begins with experience.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

May you live your life as if the maxim of your actions were to become universal law.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

What can I know? What ought I to do? What can I hope?


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Metaphysics is a dark ocean without shores or lighthouse, strewn with many a philosophic wreck.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Ingratitude is the essence of vileness.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Act that your principle of action might safely be made a law for the whole world.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Even philosophers will praise war as ennobling mankind, forgetting the Greek who said: 'War is bad in that it begets more evil than it kills.'


"
Immanuel Kant,"

I had therefore to remove knowledge, in order to make room for belief.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

So act that your principle of action might safely be made a law for the whole world.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

A categorical imperative would be one which represented an action as objectively necessary in itself, without reference to any other purpose.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

The only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil. For by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason; by the latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of reason.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Religion is the recognition of all our duties as divine commands.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

It is not God's will merely that we should be happy, but that we should make ourselves happy.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

It is not necessary that whilst I live I live happily; but it is necessary that so long as I live I should live honourably.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Intuition and concepts constitute... the elements of all our knowledge, so that neither concepts without an intuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without concepts, can yield knowledge.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

But although all our knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises from experience.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made nothing entirely straight can be carved.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

From such crooked wood as that which man is made of, nothing straight can be fashioned.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

Nothing is divine but what is agreeable to reason.


"
Immanuel Kant,"

All the interests of my reason, speculative as well as practical, combine in the three following questions: 1. What can I know? 2. What ought I to do? 3. What may I hope?


"
Immanuel Kant,"

All thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain characters, relate ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us.


"
Isaac Newton,"

If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.


"
Isaac Newton,"

I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.


"
Isaac Newton,"

I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.


"
Isaac Newton,"

We build too many walls and not enough bridges.


"
Isaac Newton,"

To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Genius is patience.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.


"
Isaac Newton,"

I have a fundamental belief in the Bible as the Word of God, written by those who were inspired. I study the Bible daily.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Atheism is so senseless. When I look at the solar system, I see the earth at the right distance from the sun to receive the proper amounts of heat and light. This did not happen by chance.


"
Isaac Newton,"

In the absence of any other proof, the thumb alone would convince me of God's existence.


"
Isaac Newton,"

What goes up must come down.


"
Isaac Newton,"

If I have done the public any service, it is due to my patient thought.


"
Isaac Newton,"

My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Plato is my friend; Aristotle is my friend, but my greatest friend is truth.


"
Isaac Newton,"

An object in motion tends to remain in motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force.


"
Isaac Newton,"

A man may imagine things that are false, but he can only understand things that are true, for if the things be false, the apprehension of them is not understanding.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.


"
Isaac Newton,"

As a blind man has no idea of colors, so have we no idea of the manner by which the all-wise God perceives and understands all things.


"
Isaac Newton,"

This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.


"
Isaac Newton,"

It is the weight, not numbers of experiments that is to be regarded.


"
Isaac Newton,"

God is the same God, always and everywhere. He is omnipresent not virtually only, but also substantially, for virtue cannot subsist without substance.


"
Isaac Newton,"

To me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science.


"
Isaac Newton,"

If a projectile were deprived of the force of gravity, it would not be deflected toward the earth but would go off in a straight line into the heavens and do so with uniform motion, provided that the resistance of the air were removed.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Errors are not in the art but in the artificers.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the divine Power, it could never put them into such a circulating motion as they have about the Sun; and therefore, for this as well as other reasons, I am compelled to ascribe the frame of this System to an intelligent Agent.


"
Isaac Newton,"

To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. 'Tis much better to do a little with certainty & leave the rest for others that come after you.


"
Isaac Newton,"

We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The description of right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to mechanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires them to be drawn.


"
Isaac Newton,"

There are more sure marks of authenticity in the Bible that in any profane history.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The proper method for inquiring after the properties of things is to deduce them from experiments.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Just as the system of the sun, planets and comets is put in motion by the forces of gravity, and its parts persist in their motions, so the smaller systems of bodies also seem to be set in motion by other forces and their particles to be variously moved in relation to each other and, especially, by the electric force.


"
Isaac Newton,"

I do not love to be printed on every occasion, much less to be dunned and teased by foreigners about mathematical things or to be thought by our own people to be trifling away my time about them when I should be about the king's business.


"
Isaac Newton,"

We account the Scriptures of God to be the most sublime philosophy.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Religion and philosophy are to be preserved distinct. We are not to introduce divine revelations into philosophy, nor philosophical opinions into religion.


"
Isaac Newton,"

I have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet assigned a cause to gravity.


"
Isaac Newton,"

All variety of created objects which represent order and life in the universe could happen only by the willful reasoning of its original Creator, whom I call the 'Lord God.'


"
Isaac Newton,"

Opposite to godliness is atheism in profession, and idolatry in practice. Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind, that it never had many professors.


"
Isaac Newton,"

I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself now and then in finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.


"
Isaac Newton,"

God made and governs the world invisibly, and has commanded us to love and worship him and no other God; to honor our parents and masters, and love our neighbours as ourselves; and to be temperate, just, and peaceable, and to be merciful even to brute beasts.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Are not rays of light very small bodies emitted from shining substances?


"
Isaac Newton,"

Christ comes as a thief in the night, & it is not for us to know the times & seasons which God hath put into his own breast.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The centre of the system of the world is immovable.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The moon gravitates towards the earth and by the force of gravity is continually drawn off from a rectilinear motion and retained in its orbit.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The motions which the planets now have could not spring from any natural cause alone, but were impressed by an intelligent Agent.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Fidelity and allegiance sworn to the King is only such a fidelity and obedience as is due to him by the law of the land; for were that faith and allegiance more than what the law requires, we would swear ourselves slaves and the King absolute; whereas, by the law, we are free men, notwithstanding those oaths.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The Ignis Fatuus is a vapor shining without heat.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The smaller the planets are, they are, other things being equal, of so much the greater density; for so the powers of gravity on their several surfaces come nearer to equality. They are likewise, other things being equal, of the greater density, as they are nearer to the sun.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Nothing can be divided into more parts than it can possibly be constituted of. But matter (i.e. finite) cannot be constituted of infinite parts.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Resistance is usually ascribed to bodies at rest, and impulse to those in motion, but motion and rest, as commonly conceived, are only relatively distinguished; nor are those bodies always truly at rest, which commonly are taken to be so.


"
Isaac Newton,"

It is reasonable that forces directed toward bodies depend on the nature and the quantity of matter of such bodies, as happens in the case of magnetic bodies.


"
Isaac Newton,"

It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent because the parts of that immovable space, in which those motions are performed, do by no means come under the observation of our senses.


"
Isaac Newton,"

Why there is one body in our System qualified to give light and heat to all the rest, I know no reason but because the Author of the System thought it convenient; and why there is but one body of this kind, I know no reason, but because one was sufficient to warm and enlighten all the rest.


"
Isaac Newton,"

It may be that there is no such thing as an equable motion, whereby time may be accurately measured. All motions may be accelerated or retarded, but the true, or equable, progress of absolute time is liable to no change.


"
Isaac Newton,"

We are certainly not to relinquish the evidence of experiments for the sake of dreams and vain fictions of our own devising; nor are we to recede from the analogy of Nature, which is wont to be simple and always consonant to itself.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The word 'God' usually signifies 'Lord', but every lord is not a God. It is the dominion of a spiritual being which constitutes a God: a true, supreme, or imaginary dominion makes a true, supreme, or imaginary God.


"
Isaac Newton,"

'God' is a relative word and has a respect to servants, and 'Deity' is the dominion of God, not over his own body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of the world, but over servants.


"
Isaac Newton,"

I there represent that I sent notice of my method to Mr. Leibnitz before he sent notice of his method to me, and left him to make it appear that he had found his method before the date of my letter.


"
Isaac Newton,"

In experimental philosophy, we are to look upon propositions inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur by which they may either be made more accurate or liable to exceptions.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The same law takes place in a system, consisting of many bodies, as in one single body, with regard to their persevering in their state of motion or of rest. For the progressive motion, whether of one single body or of a whole system of bodies, is always to be estimated from the motion of the center of gravity.


"
Isaac Newton,"

The best and safest method of philosophizing seems to be first to inquire diligently into the properties of things, and establishing those properties by experiments, and then to proceed more slowly to hypotheses for the explanation of them.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty, charm and adventure. There is no end to the adventures that we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Time is not measured by the passing of years but by what one does, what one feels, and what one achieves.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Life is like a game of cards. The hand you are dealt is determinism; the way you play it is free will.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

The art of a people is a true mirror to their minds.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Culture is the widening of the mind and of the spirit.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Failure comes only when we forget our ideals and objectives and principles.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Facts are facts and will not disappear on account of your likes.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Ignorance is always afraid of change.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

I have become a queer mixture of the East and the West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new; when an age ends; and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

What we really are matters more than what other people think of us.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Democracy and socialism are means to an end, not the end itself.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Every little thing counts in a crisis.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Peace is not a relationship of nations. It is a condition of mind brought about by a serenity of soul. Peace is not merely the absence of war. It is also a state of mind. Lasting peace can come only to peaceful people.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Socialism is... not only a way of life, but a certain scientific approach to social and economic problems.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

The policy of being too cautious is the greatest risk of all.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Without peace, all other dreams vanish and are reduced to ashes.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Great causes and little men go ill together.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Citizenship consists in the service of the country.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

The person who talks most of his own virtue is often the least virtuous.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Crises and deadlocks when they occur have at least this advantage, that they force us to think.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

The only alternative to coexistence is codestruction.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Obviously, the highest type of efficiency is that which can utilize existing material to the best advantage.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Democracy is good. I say this because other systems are worse.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

It is the habit of every aggressor nation to claim that it is acting on the defensive.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

It is only too easy to make suggestions and later try to escape the consequences of what we say.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Action itself, so long as I am convinced that it is right action, gives me satisfaction.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

You don't change the course of history by turning the faces of portraits to the wall.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Action to be effective must be directed to clearly conceived ends.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

A leader or a man of action in a crisis almost always acts subconsciously and then thinks of the reasons for his action.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Loyal and efficient work in a great cause, even though it may not be immediately recognized, ultimately bears fruit.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

To be in good moral condition requires at least as much training as to be in good physical condition.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

A theory must be tempered with reality.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

The forces in a capitalist society, if left unchecked, tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

The person who runs away exposes himself to that very danger more than a person who sits quietly.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

There is perhaps nothing so bad and so dangerous in life as fear.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

The purely agitational attitude is not good enough for a detailed consideration of a subject.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Let us be a little humble; let us think that the truth may not perhaps be entirely with us.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

Our chief defect is that we are more given to talking about things than to doing them.


"
Jawaharlal Nehru,"

The man who has gotten everything he wants is all in favor of peace and order.

Jeff Bezos,"

A brand for a company is like a reputation for a person. You earn reputation by trying to do hard things well.

The human brain is an incredible pattern-matching machine.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

I believe you have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

What we need to do is always lean into the future; when the world changes around you and when it changes against you - what used to be a tail wind is now a head wind - you have to lean into that and figure out what to do because complaining isn't a strategy.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful.

Jeff Bezos,"

If you don't understand the details of your business you are going to fail.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

If you can't tolerate critics, don't do anything new or interesting.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering.

What consumerism really is, at its worst is getting people to buy things that don't actually improve their lives.

Jeff Bezos,"

There'll always be serendipity involved in discovery.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

It's not an experiment if you know it's going to work.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you. It just works.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

Our motto at Blue Origin is 'Gradatim Ferociter': 'Step by Step, Ferociously.'


"
Jeff Bezos,"

The common question that gets asked in business is, 'why?' That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, 'why not?'


"
Jeff Bezos,"

There are two kinds of companies, those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less. We will be the second.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

We've had three big ideas at Amazon that we've stuck with for 18 years, and they're the reason we're successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

Great industries are never made from single companies. There is room in space for a lot of winners.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

There are two ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you're good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills. Kindle is an example of working backward.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

A company shouldn't get addicted to being shiny, because shiny doesn't last.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

My view is there's no bad time to innovate.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

Because, you know, resilience - if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush, then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone. But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget. Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

If your customer base is aging with you, then eventually you are going to become obsolete or irrelevant. You need to be constantly figuring out who are your new customers and what are you doing to stay forever young.

Jeff Bezos,"

People will visit Mars, they will settle mars, and we should because it's cool.

Amazon.com strives to be the e-commerce destination where consumers can find and discover anything they want to buy online.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

You don't want to negotiate the price of simple things you buy every day.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

A life of stasis would be population control, combined with energy rationing. That is the stasis world that you live in if you stay. And even with improvements in efficiency, you'll still have to ration energy. That, to me, doesn't sound like a very exciting civilization for our grandchildren's grandchildren to live in.

Jeff Bezos,"

The special ops guys and the firefighters around the world have this great phrase. They say, 'Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast,' and that is true. Everything I've accomplished in my life has been because of that attitude.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

I don't think that you can invent on behalf of customers unless you're willing to think long-term, because a lot of invention doesn't work. If you're going to invent, it means you're going to experiment, and if you're going to experiment, you're going to fail, and if you're going to fail, you have to think long term.

Jeff Bezos,"

Percentage margins don't matter. What matters always is dollar margins: the actual dollar amount. Companies are valued not on their percentage margins, but on how many dollars they actually make, and a multiple of that.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

No matter what your mission is, have some notion in your head. Forget the model, whether it's government or nonprofit or profit. Ask yourself the more important question: Is my mission improving the world? Are you sure about it? Seek to disconfirm that all the time. And if you can, change your mission.

One of the things that I'm very excited about with New Shepard, which is our suborbital tourism vehicle, is using that to get a lot of practice. One of the equilibria that we're at today with space launch is that we don't get to practice enough.

Jeff Bezos,"

I have won this lottery. It's a gigantic lottery, and it's called Amazon.com. And I'm using my lottery winnings to push us a little further into space.


"
Jeff Bezos,"

If your payloads cost hundreds of millions of dollars, they actually cost more than the launch. It puts a lot of pressure on the launch vehicle not to change, to be very stable. Reliability becomes much more important than the cost. It's hard to get off of that equilibrium.

There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.

One is never afraid of the unknown; one is afraid of the known coming to an end.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

What is needed, rather than running away or controlling or suppressing or any other resistance, is understanding fear; that means, watch it, learn about it, come directly into contact with it. We are to learn about fear, not how to escape from it.

Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay.

We all want to be famous people, and the moment we want to be something we are no longer free.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Have you not noticed that love is silence? It may be while holding the hand of another, or looking lovingly at a child, or taking in the beauty of an evening. Love has no past or future, and so it is with this extraordinary state of silence.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong, but just to watch it and move with it. In that watching, you begin to understand the whole movement of thought and feeling. And out of this awareness comes silence.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

The constant assertion of belief is an indication of fear.

Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

With increasing age, dullness of mind and heart sets in.

If you begin to understand what you are without trying to change it, then what you are undergoes a transformation.

If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it, because the answer is not separate from the problem.

Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing and dance, and write poems and suffer and understand, for all that is life.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

If we depend for our happiness on another, on society or on environment, they become essential to us; we cling to them, and any alteration of these we violently oppose because we depend upon them for our psychological security and comfort.

Life is relationship, living is relationship. We cannot live if you and I have built a wall around ourselves and just peep over that wall occasionally. Unconsciously, deeply, under the wall, we are related.

A man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of any kind is really a free, a peaceful man.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

For most of us, relationship with another is based on dependence, either economic or psychological. This dependence creates fear, breeds in us possessiveness, results in friction, suspicion, frustration.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

We are second-hand people. We have lived on what we have been told, either guided by our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to accept by circumstances and environment. We are the result of all kinds of influences, and there is nothing new in us, nothing that we have discovered for ourselves: nothing original, pristine, clear.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

So when you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Life cannot be without relationship, but we have made it so agonizing and hideous by basing it on personal and possessive love. Can one love and yet not possess? You will find the true answer not in escape, ideals, beliefs but through the understanding of the causes of dependence and possessiveness.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Religion is the frozen thought of man out of which they build temples.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Have you ever asked yourselves what you are going to do when you grow up? In all likelihood you will get married, and before you know where you are, you will be mothers and fathers; and you will then be tied to a job, or to the kitchen, in which you will gradually wither away. Is that all that your life is going to be?


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

We are domesticated animals, revolving in a cage which we have built for ourselves - with its contentions, wranglings, its impossible political leaders, its gurus who exploit our self-conceit and their own with great refinement or rather crudely.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

We never look deeply into the quality of a tree; we never really touch it, feel its solidity, its rough bark, and hear the sound that is part of the tree. Not the sound of wind through the leaves, not the breeze of a morning that flutters the leaves, but its own sound, the sound of the trunk and the silent sound of the roots.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

The end is the beginning of all things, Suppressed and hidden, Awaiting to be released through the rhythm Of pain and pleasure.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Can the mind see the truth of its own incapacity to know the unknown? Surely if I see very clearly that my mind cannot know the unknown, there is absolute quietness.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

What religion a man holds, to what race he belongs, these things are not important; the really important thing is this knowledge: the knowledge of God's plan for men. For God has a plan, and that plan is evolution.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

The question of whether or not there is a God or truth or reality or whatever you like to call it, can never be answered by books, by priests, philosopher's or saviours. Nobody and nothing can answer the question but you yourself, and that is why you must know yourself - Immaturity lies only in total ignorance of self.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Truth cannot be brought down; rather, the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. You cannot bring the mountaintop to the valley. If you would attain to the mountaintop, you must pass through the valley, climb the steeps, unafraid of the dangerous precipices.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

To live is to find out for yourself what is true, and you can do this only when there is freedom, when there is continuous revolution inwardly, within yourself.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Why does your mind conform? Have you ever asked? Are you aware that you are conforming to a pattern? It doesn't matter what that pattern is, whether you have established a pattern for yourself or it has been established for you.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

It is odd that we have so little relationship with nature, with the insects and the leaping frog and the owl that hoots among the hills calling for its mate. We never seem to have a feeling for all living things on the earth.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

In seeking comfort, we generally find a quiet corner in life where there is a minimum of conflict, and then we are afraid to step out of that seclusion.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Freedom from the desire for an answer is essential to the understanding of a problem.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

If you have fear, you are bound by tradition, you follow some leader or guru. When you are bound by tradition, when you are afraid of your husband or your wife, you lose your dignity as an individual human being.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

It is really very important while you are young to live in an environment in which there is no fear. Most of us, as we grow older, become frightened; we are afraid of living, afraid of losing a job, afraid of tradition, afraid of what the neighbours, or what the wife or husband would say, afraid of death.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

All ideologies are idiotic, whether religious or political, for it is conceptual thinking, the conceptual word, which has so unfortunately divided man.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

The environment that we call society is created by past generations; we accept it, as it helps us to maintain our greed, possessiveness, illusion.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

When one travels around the world, one notices to what an extraordinary degree human nature is the same, whether in India or America, in Europe or Australia.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

If we could establish a deep abiding relationship with nature, we would never kill an animal for our appetite; we would never harm, vivisect, a monkey, a dog, a guinea pig for our benefit. We would find other ways to heal our wounds, heal our bodies.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

A consistent thinker is a thoughtless person, because he conforms to a pattern; he repeats phrases and thinks in a groove.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

We do not know what love is. We know the symptoms of it, the pleasure, the pain, the fear, the anxiety and so on. We try to solve the symptoms, which becomes a wandering in darkness. We spend our days and nights in this, and it is soon over in death.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

In this constant battle which we call living, we try to set a code of conduct according to the society in which we are brought up, whether it be a Communist society or a so-called free society; we accept a standard of behaviour as part of our tradition as Hindus or Muslims or Christians or whatever we happen to be.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

It is violence when we use a sharp word, when we make a gesture to brush away a person. So violence isn't merely organized butchery in the name of God, in the name of society or country. Violence is much more subtle, much deeper.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Truth is a pathless land.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Man has throughout the ages been seeking something beyond himself, beyond material welfare - something we call truth or God or reality, a timeless state - something that cannot be disturbed by circumstances, by thought or by human corruption.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Is it not important to find out how to listen not only to what is being said but to everything - to the noise in the streets, to the chatter of birds, to the noise of the tramcar, to the restless sea, to the voice of your husband, to your wife, to your friends, to the cry of a baby?


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

When we talk about understanding, surely it takes place only when the mind listens completely - the mind being your heart, your nerves, your ears - when you give your whole attention to it.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Organized murder is war, and though we demonstrate against a particular war, the nuclear, or any other kind of war, we have never demonstrated against war.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

If you listen through the screen of your desires, then you obviously listen to your own voice; you are listening to your own desires.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

I want to do a certain thing in the world, and I am going to do it with unwavering concentration. I am concerning myself with only one essential thing: to set man free. I desire to free him from all cages, from all fears, and not to found religions, new sects, nor to establish new theories and new philosophies.


"
Jiddu Krishnamurti,"

Listening has importance only when one is not projecting one's own desires through which one listens.

"
Jim Rohn,"

Affirmation without discipline is the beginning of delusion.


"
Jim Rohn,"

The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it. What it makes of you will always be the far greater value than what you get.


"
Jim Rohn,"

You don't get paid for the hour. You get paid for the value you bring to the hour.


"
Jim Rohn,"

Failure is not a single, cataclysmic event. You don't fail overnight. Instead, failure is a few errors in judgement, repeated every day.


"
Jim Rohn,"

Success is doing ordinary things extraordinarily well.


"
Jim Rohn,"

Don't wish it were easier, wish you were better.


"
Jim Rohn,"

Asking is the beginning of receiving. Make sure you don't go to the ocean with a teaspoon. At least take a bucket so the kids won't laugh at you.

Jim Rohn,"

When you know what you want, and want it bad enough, you will find a way to get it.

Jim Rohn,"

The worst thing one can do is not to try, to be aware of what one wants and not give in to it, to spend years in silent hurt wondering if something could have materialized - never knowing.


"
Jim Rohn,"

Don't bring your need to the marketplace, bring your skill. If you don't feel well, tell your doctor, but not the marketplace. If you need money, go to the bank, but not the marketplace.

It doesn't matter which side of the fence you get off on sometimes. What matters most is getting off. You cannot make progress without making decisions.

"
John F. Kennedy,"

Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basis of dynamic and creative intellectual activity.

John F. Kennedy,"

Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.

John F. Kennedy,"

Mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind.

John F. Kennedy,"

We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or to watch - we are going back from whence we came.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Our problems are man-made, therefore they may be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Domestic policy can only defeat us; foreign policy can kill us.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners, and necessity has made us allies. Those whom God has so joined together, let no man put asunder.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Too often we... enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

The cost of freedom is always high, but Americans have always paid it. And one path we shall never choose, and that is the path of surrender, or submission.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the area of man's concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

The goal of education is the advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of truth.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Mothers all want their sons to grow up to be president, but they don't want them to become politicians in the process.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie, deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

The greater our knowledge increases the more our ignorance unfolds.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Washington is a city of Southern efficiency and Northern charm.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

It is an unfortunate fact that we can secure peace only by preparing for war.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

When written in Chinese, the word 'crisis' is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Tolerance implies no lack of commitment to one's own beliefs. Rather it condemns the oppression or persecution of others.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Israel was not created in order to disappear - Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris, and I have enjoyed it.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered at the White House - with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

For time and the world do not stand still. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Communism has never come to power in a country that was not disrupted by war or corruption, or both.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

A child miseducated is a child lost.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's futures. And we are all mortal.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

We stand today on the edge of a new frontier - the frontier of the 1960's - a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils - a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

The best road to progress is freedom's road.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

A man does what he must - in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures - and that is the basis of all human morality.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty, and all forms of human life.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us thru that darkness to a safe and sane future.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

If we cannot now end our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. The human mind is our fundamental resource.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility - I welcome it.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

War will exist until that distant day when the conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation and prestige that the warrior does today.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

There is always inequality in life. Some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded and some men never leave the country. Life is unfair.


"
John F. Kennedy,"

I just received the following wire from my generous Daddy; Dear Jack, Don't buy a single vote more than is necessary. I'll be damned if I'm going to pay for a landslide.


"
John Keats,"

A thing of beauty is a joy forever: its loveliness increases; it will never pass into nothingness.


"
John Keats,"

I love you the more in that I believe you had liked me for my own sake and for nothing else.


"
John Keats,"

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter.


"
John Keats,"

Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced.


"
John Keats,"

What the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth.


"
John Keats,"

Now a soft kiss - Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss.


"
John Keats,"

'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' - that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.


"
John Keats,"

I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the heart's affections, and the truth of imagination.


"
John Keats,"

Scenery is fine - but human nature is finer.

John Keats,"

The poetry of the earth is never dead.


"
John Keats,"

My imagination is a monastery and I am its monk.

John Keats,"

Love is my religion - I could die for it.


"
John Keats,"

Philosophy will clip an angel's wings.


"
John Keats,"

You are always new, the last of your kisses was ever the sweetest.


"
John Keats,"

There is nothing stable in the world; uproar's your only music.


"
John Keats,"

Here lies one whose name was writ in water.


"
John Keats,"

Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by singularity, it should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.


"
John Keats,"

The only means of strengthening one's intellect is to make up one's mind about nothing, to let the mind be a thoroughfare for all thoughts.


"
John Keats,"

The excellency of every art is its intensity, capable of making all disagreeable evaporate.


"
John Keats,"

I will give you a definition of a proud man: he is a man who has neither vanity nor wisdom one filled with hatreds cannot be vain, neither can he be wise.


"
John Keats,"

Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul?


"
John Keats,"

There is an electric fire in human nature tending to purify - so that among these human creatures there is continually some birth of new heroism. The pity is that we must wonder at it, as we should at finding a pearl in rubbish.


"
John Keats,"

I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks, your loveliness and the hour of my death. O that I could have possession of them both in the same minute.


"
John Keats,"

I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest.


"
John Keats,"

Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself, but with its subject.


"
John Keats,"

I have been astonished that men could die martyrs for religion - I have shuddered at it. I shudder no more - I could be martyred for my religion - Love is my religion - I could die for that.


"
John Keats,"

Much have I traveled in the realms of gold, and many goodly states and kingdoms seen.


"
John Keats,"

Land and sea, weakness and decline are great separators, but death is the great divorcer for ever.


"
John Keats,"

There is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object.


"
John Keats,"

With a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.


"
John Keats,"

You speak of Lord Byron and me; there is this great difference between us. He describes what he sees I describe what I imagine. Mine is the hardest task.


"
John Keats,"

The Public - a thing I cannot help looking upon as an enemy, and which I cannot address without feelings of hostility.


"
John Keats,"

Poetry should... should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.


"
John Keats,"

I am in that temper that if I were under water I would scarcely kick to come to the top.


"
John Keats,"

Praise or blame has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own works.


"
John Keats,"

It appears to me that almost any man may like the spider spin from his own inwards his own airy citadel.


"
John Keats,"

He ne'er is crowned with immortality Who fears to follow where airy voices lead.


"
John Keats,"

Though a quarrel in the streets is a thing to be hated, the energies displayed in it are fine; the commonest man shows a grace in his quarrel.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I think the thing to do is enjoy the ride while you're on it.


"
Johnny Depp,"

People say I make strange choices, but they're not strange for me. My sickness is that I'm fascinated by human behavior, by what's underneath the surface, by the worlds inside people.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Me, I'm dishonest, and you can always trust a dishonest man to be dishonest. Honestly, it's the honest ones you have to watch out for.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Life's pretty good, and why wouldn't it be? I'm a pirate, after all.


"
Johnny Depp,"

As a teenager I was so insecure. I was the type of guy that never fitted in because he never dared to choose. I was convinced I had absolutely no talent at all. For nothing. And that thought took away all my ambition too.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Tomorrow it'll all be over, then I'll have to go back to selling pens again.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I'm an old-fashioned guy... I want to be an old man with a beer belly sitting on a porch, looking at a lake or something.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I am doing things that are true to me. The only thing I have a problem with is being labeled.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Escapism is survival to me.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Here's the thing - if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, in a kind of historical way, it's exciting because we will see the actual last president of the United States. It just won't work after that.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I think everybody's nuts.


"
Johnny Depp,"

The only creatures that are evolved enough to convey pure love are dogs and infants.


"
Johnny Depp,"

With any part you play, there is a certain amount of yourself in it. There has to be, otherwise it's just not acting. It's lying.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I've had the honor and the pleasure and gift of having known Elizabeth Taylor for a number of years. You know, you sit down with her, she slings hash, she sits there and cusses like a sailor, and she's hilarious.


"
Johnny Depp,"

There's a drive in me that won't allow me to do certain things that are easy.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Am I a romantic? I've seen 'Wuthering Heights' ten times. I'm a romantic.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I don't pretend to be captain weird. I just do what I do.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I started out printing silk screen t-shirts. I sold ink pens. I worked construction. I worked at a gas station. I pumped gas. I was a mechanic for a little bit. I went into sewers, down into sewer lines. I had a lot of somewhat unpleasant gigs for a time there.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Simplicity - that's what I want. It's been a rare commodity for me for a number of years, but I enjoy being able to hang out with my girl, read the newspaper, and sit back and start to read a book by someone I admire, like Lawrence Krauss or Christopher Hitchens. And that's it - simplicity, where the game of Hollywood doesn't exist.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I'm shy, paranoid, whatever word you want to use. I hate fame. I've done everything I can to avoid it.


"
Johnny Depp,"

If there's any message to my work, it is ultimately that it's OK to be different, that it's good to be different, that we should question ourselves before we pass judgment on someone who looks different, behaves different, talks different, is a different color.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I'm not sure I'm adult yet.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I have this fear of clowns, so I think that if I surround myself with them, it will ward off all evil.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I like the challenge of trying different things and wondering whether it's going to work or whether I'm going to fall flat on my face.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Puberty was very vague. I literally locked myself in a room and played guitar.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I detest jokes - when somebody tells me one, I feel my IQ dropping; the brain cells start to disappear. But something is funny when the person delivering the line doesn't know it's funny or doesn't treat it as a joke. Maybe it comes from a place of truth, or it's a sort of rage against society.


"
Johnny Depp,"

There's definitely healing properties to being in proximity to the ocean and that breeze. There's something about that Caribbean climate and humidity.


"
Johnny Depp,"

My favorite color is black.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I made odd noises as a child. Just did weird things, like turn off light switches twice. I think my parents thought I had Tourette's syndrome.


"
Johnny Depp,"

You grow up a bit damaged or broken then you have some success but you don't know how to feel good about the work you're doing or the life you're leading.


"
Johnny Depp,"

The beauty, the poetry of the fear in their eyes. I didn't mind going to jail for, what, five, six hours? It was absolutely worth it.


"
Johnny Depp,"

There's no truth anymore.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I don't go anywhere without a book by James Joyce called 'Finnegan's Wake.'


"
Johnny Depp,"

France, and the whole of Europe have a great culture and an amazing history. Most important thing though is that people there know how to live! In America they've forgotten all about it. I'm afraid that the American culture is a disaster.


"
Johnny Depp,"

There is nothing on earth that could ever make me want to relive certain years of my life when I was young.


"
Johnny Depp,"

When kids hit one year old, it's like hanging out with a miniature drunk. You have to hold onto them. They bump into things. They laugh and cry. They urinate. They vomit.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I don't know if I can relax. Relax, I can't do. My brain, on idle, is a bad thing. I just get weird. I mean, not weird. I get, I get antsy.


"
Johnny Depp,"

One of the most beautiful things in the world is seeing a mommy with her kids. There's nothing more beautiful, nothing more sublime.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I pretty much try to stay in a constant state of confusion just because of the expression it leaves on my face.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I'll take photographs with kids. People who want to take photographs with me. People who like the movies. People who supported me. I'll do that all day, all night, that's fine. But the bombardment of the paparazzi is just... I truly don't understand. It just feels like this kind of gluttonous, horrific sport. It's like sport.


"
Johnny Depp,"

You use your money to buy privacy because during most of your life you aren't allowed to be normal.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I moved from Kentucky to Miramar, Florida, at about 8. I think I was in second grade. I still had my Southern accent, and down there, you got to experience a melting pot in full fury. All the kids I hung out with were, like, Sicilian kids from Jersey and New York.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Everything is just very, very blurry. I've never had proper vision.


"
Johnny Depp,"

If someone is being bullied or feels like an outsider, and they relate to something that I've done, even if it's just igniting a spark, that's great. I had that feeling as a kid. I was messed with no end.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I may have a feather duster down my pants.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I always wanted to be a character actor rather than the poster boy that they tried to make me 100 years ago. An actor has a degree of responsibility to change for the audience, to give them something new each time, to surprise and not bore them.


"
Johnny Depp,"

When you have children, there is no room for lies, no room for anything but the truth. Anything other than that is a bad example, I believe.


"
Johnny Depp,"

When I auditioned for '21 Jump Street,' it was a last minute thing. I had one of the worst flus that I've ever experienced in my life, and I was forced to go to the audition, the screen test.


"
Johnny Depp,"

How many chances to you get to make a musical about a serial killer? The minute Tim Burton approached me, I was in.


"
Johnny Depp,"

It's such a funny thing when you see your daughter transitioning from your baby, your little girl, to suddenly being a young woman. If you're not really looking for it, you can miss it, and Lily-Rose is on that road already, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Music is still part of my life, but I hate the idea of people coming to see me play the guitar because they've seen me in movies. You want people who are listening to be only interested in the music.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I've never felt particularly ambitious or driven, that's for sure, although I like to create stuff, whether it's a little doodle, a drawing, a small painting or a movie or a piece of music, so I suppose I'm driven by that. Everything I've done has felt very natural, and it's happened because it's happened.


"
Johnny Depp,"

For a long time I tried to manage an honesty and openness about my personal life because I'm human and I'm normal - well, semi-normal.


"
Johnny Depp,"

With my kids, they're told 75 times a day that they're loved. One thing I know is they feel loved and secure and happy and needed and necessary and a part of something.


"
Johnny Depp,"

When I can focus on something like guitar or painting, I do. I started painting people I admire, like Kerouac, Bob Dylan, Nelson Algren, Marlon Brando, Patti Smith, my girl, my kids.


"
Johnny Depp,"

Captain Jack Sparrow is like a cross between Keith Richards and Pepe Le Pew.


"
Johnny Depp,"

I'm always for the Indian in the cowboy movie. Always.


"
Johnny Depp,"

What I love to do is paint people's faces, y'know, their eyes. Because you want to find that emotion, see what's going on behind their eyes.


"
Johnny Depp,"

The only gossip I'm interested in is things from the Weekly World News - 'Woman's bra bursts, 11 injured'. That kind of thing.


"
Johnny Depp,"

America is dumb. It's like a dumb puppy that has big teeth that can bite and hurt you - aggressive. My daughter is four; my boy is one. I'd like them to see America as a toy - a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling, and then get out.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Don't compare yourself with other people; compare yourself with who you were yesterday.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

It's in responsibility that most people find the meaning that sustains them through life. It's not in happiness. It's not in impulsive pleasure.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Abortion is clearly wrong.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I don't tell people, 'You're okay the way that you are.' That's not the right story. The right story is, 'You're way less than you could be.'


"
Jordan Peterson,"

The idea that women were oppressed throughout history is an appalling theory.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

'Happiness' is a pointless goal.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

The truth is something that burns. It burns off dead wood. And people don't like having the dead wood burnt off, often because they're 95 percent dead wood.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Adopt responsibility for your own well-being, try to put your family together, try to serve your community, try to seek for eternal truth... That's the sort of thing that can ground you in your life, enough so that you can withstand the difficulty of life.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

It is more difficult to rule yourself than to rule a city.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Free speech is not just another value. It's the foundation of Western civilization.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

No one gets away with anything, ever, so take responsibility for your own life.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

There's a personality trait known as agreeableness. Agreeable people are compassionate and polite. And agreeable people get paid less than disagreeable people for the same job. Women are more agreeable than men.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Life is tragic. You are tiny and flawed and ignorant and weak, and everything else is huge, complex, and overwhelming.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Women deeply want men who are competent and powerful. And I don't mean power in that they can exert tyrannical control over others. That's not power. That's just corruption.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Power is competence.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Don't lie about anything, ever. Lying leads to Hell.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Don't be dependent. At all. Ever. Period.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

If you're talking to a man who wouldn't fight with you under any circumstances whatsoever, then you're talking to someone for whom you have absolutely no respect.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

One of the things I've told men over and over and over and over is if you're being rejected by all the women that you approach, it's not the women!


"
Jordan Peterson,"

It makes sense that a witch lives in a swamp.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

If you don't stand your ground, then all that happens is people push you backwards.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I have something in common with Nazis in that I am opposed to the radical Left. And when you oppose the radical Left, you end up being a part of a much larger group that includes Nazis in it.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Life is very difficult. One of the most ancient of religious ideas that emerges everywhere, I would say, is that life is essentially suffering.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

When you start to realise how much of what you've constructed of yourself is based on deception and lies, that is a horrifying realisation.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

To me, ideology is corrupt; it's a parasite on religious structures. To be an ideologue is to have all of the terrible things that are associated with religious certainty and none of the utility. If you're an ideologue, you believe everything that you think. If you're religious, there's a mystery left there.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Music has an intrinsic meaning, which has always been mysterious to me.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

The people who hold that our culture is an oppressive patriarchy, they don't want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Part of the core information that I've been purveying is that identity politics is a sick game. You don't play racial, ethnic, and gender identity games. The Left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the Right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride. I think they're equally dangerous.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

It's very hard to find your own words - and you don't actually exist until you have your own words.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Become aware of your own insufficiency.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

If you're not going to be rewarded for your virtues, and instead you're going to be punished for them, then what's your motivation to continue?


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Men and women aren't the same. And they won't be the same. That doesn't mean that they can't be treated fairly.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

To master a new technology, you have to play with it.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

You can't go backward in life.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

You can't have a value structure without a hierarchy. They're the same thing because a value structure means one thing takes precedence over another.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I could hardly sit through 'Frozen.' There was an attempt to craft a moral message and to build the story around that, instead of building the story and letting the moral message emerge. It was the subjugation of art to propaganda, in my estimation.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

We're so immaturely cynical as a culture. We're not wise enough to look at an institution like marriage and to really things about what it means and what it signifies. It signifies a place where people can tie the ropes of their lives together so that they're stronger. It signifies a place where people can tell the truth to one another.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

There were some great clinicians in the 20th century - great men. Freud was a genius; Jung was a genius, Carl Rogers was a genius - there's a half-dozen psychologists of the 1950s and humanists of the 1960s.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

We have to rediscover the eternal values and then live them out.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

The masculine spirit is under assault. It's obvious.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

The most propagandistic element of 'Frozen' was the transformation of the prince at the beginning of the story, who was a perfectly good guy, into a villain with no character development whatsoever about three-quarters of the way to the ending.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

It's very difficult to regulate yourself, and if you learn to do that, well, it starts to spill over.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I have a hard time figuring out what kind of box to put me in, too, because I don't know exactly what's going on around me or why. But I need to stay outside of boxes because then I can look at what's inside of them without being part of them.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Once someone has spent enough time cultivating bad habits and biding their time, they are much diminished. Much of what they could have been has dissipated.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

It's not just human nature to associate in tribes. It's deeper than that.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

Assuming if there's such a thing as reality, if you have a false relationship with it, how can you do anything but fail?


"
Jordan Peterson,"

If you learn a martial art, you learn to be dangerous, but simultaneously, you learn to control it.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

As pessimistic as I am about the nature of human beings and our capacity for atrocity and malevolence and betrayal and laziness and inertia, and all those things, I think we can transcend all that and set things straight.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

A properly balanced story provides an equal representation of the negative and positive attributes of, I could say the world, but it's actually a being. 'Harry Potter''s a good example. So Harry's the hero, right. But he's tainted with evil. There's a dark and a light in every bit of that narrative. It's well balanced.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I am not going to be a mouthpiece for language that I detest.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

You may say, 'Well, dragons don't exist.' It's, like, yes they do - the category 'predator' and the category 'dragon' are the same category. It absolutely exists. It's a superordinate category. It exists absolutely more than anything else. In fact, it really exists.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

It's a small percentage of people who do the 80-hour-a-week high-powered career thing, and they're almost all men. Why? Well, men are driven by socio-economic status more than women.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I happen to be a big fan of Western civilization; I think it beats the hell out of tyranny and starvation.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I like working-class people, generally speaking.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I've studied authoritarianism for a very long time - for 40 years - and they're started by people's attempts to control the ideological and linguistic territory.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

You can think of the entire Internet as a place where ideas embodied in cyberspace are having a war, and it's not much different than the war of gods in heaven, which has been taking place since there's been human beings.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

You have to listen very carefully and tell the truth if you are going to get a paranoid person to open up to you.


"
Jordan Peterson,"

I'm interested in what motivates individuals to participate in atrocious acts to support their ideological identification.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

Death is the solution to all problems. No man - no problem.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

It is enough that the people know there was an election. The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

I trust no one, not even myself.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

Ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas.

Joseph Stalin,"

Education is a weapon whose effects depend on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic.

When we hang the capitalists they will sell us the rope we use.

The Pope? How many divisions has he got?


"
Joseph Stalin,"

You cannot make a revolution with silk gloves.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

Gratitude is a sickness suffered by dogs.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

Mankind is divided into rich and poor, into property owners and exploited; and to abstract oneself from this fundamental division; and from the antagonism between poor and rich means abstracting oneself from fundamental facts.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

A sincere diplomat is like dry water or wooden iron.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

Gaiety is the most outstanding feature of the Soviet Union.

If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army can reach.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

History shows that there are no invincible armies.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

If any foreign minister begins to defend to the death a 'peace conference', you can be sure his government has already placed its orders for new battleships and airplanes.

Joseph Stalin,"

We don't let them have ideas. Why would we let them have guns?


"
Joseph Stalin,"

The writer is the engineer of the human soul.


"
Joseph Stalin,"

Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party.

"
Karl Marx,"

Social progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex.


"
Karl Marx,"

The only antidote to mental suffering is physical pain.


"
Karl Marx,"

Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!

Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form.


"

Capital is dead labor, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks.


"
Karl Marx,"

If anything is certain, it is that I myself am not a Marxist.


"
Karl Marx,"

Necessity is blind until it becomes conscious. Freedom is the consciousness of necessity.


"
Karl Marx,"

Religion is the opium of the masses.


"
Karl Marx,"

The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence: Abolish all private property.


"
Karl Marx,"

The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism.


"
Karl Marx,"

The rich will do anything for the poor but get off their backs.


"
Karl Marx,"

Revolutions are the locomotives of history.


"
Karl Marx,"

The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.


"
Karl Marx,"

Anyone who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without feminine upheaval. Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex, the ugly ones included.


"
Karl Marx,"

Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand.


"
Karl Marx,"

Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand.

Nothing can have value without being an object of utility.

Art is always and everywhere the secret confession, and at the same time the immortal movement of its time.


"
Karl Marx,"

The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles.

Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.


"
Karl Marx,"

The first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion.


"
Karl Marx,"

The writer must earn money in order to be able to live and to write, but he must by no means live and write for the purpose of making money.


"
Karl Marx,"

The more the division of labor and the application of machinery extend, the more does competition extend among the workers, the more do their wages shrink together.


"
Karl Marx,"

The worker of the world has nothing to lose, but their chains, workers of the world unite.


"
Karl Marx,"

Landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed.


"
Karl Marx,"

Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the laborer, unless under compulsion from society.


"
Karl Marx,"

History does nothing; it does not possess immense riches, it does not fight battles. It is men, real, living, who do all this.


"
Karl Marx,"

The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal, not merely a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society.


"
Karl Marx,"

Men's ideas are the most direct emanations of their material state.


"
Karl Marx,"

We should not say that one man's hour is worth another man's hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing: he is at the most time's carcass.


"
Karl Marx,"

In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.


"
Karl Marx,"

Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer.


"
Karl Marx,"

For the bureaucrat, the world is a mere object to be manipulated by him.


"
Karl Marx,"

In a higher phase of communist society... only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.


"

While the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser.


"

Medicine heals doubts as well as diseases.


"
Karl Marx,"

Machines were, it may be said, the weapon employed by the capitalists to quell the revolt of specialized labor.


"
Karl Marx,"

A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of communism.


"
Karl Marx,"

The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force.


"
Karl Marx,"

Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.


"
Karl Marx,"

The English have all the material requisites for the revolution. What they lack is the spirit of generalization and revolutionary ardour.


"
Karl Marx,"

The writer may very well serve a movement of history as its mouthpiece, but he cannot of course create it.


"
Karl Marx,"

It is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends. History is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends.


"
Karl Marx,"

Greek philosophy seems to have met with something with which a good tragedy is not supposed to meet, namely, a dull ending.


"
Karl Marx,"

The product of mental labor - science - always stands far below its value, because the labor-time necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production.


"
Karl Marx,"

The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future.


"
Karl Marx,"

It is absolutely impossible to transcend the laws of nature. What can change in historically different circumstances is only the form in which these laws expose themselves.


"
Karl Marx,"

The development of civilization and industry in general has always shown itself so active in the destruction of forests that everything that has been done for their conservation and production is completely insignificant in comparison.


"
Karl Marx,"

A commodity appears at first sight an extremely obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.


"
Karl Marx,"

Without doubt, machinery has greatly increased the number of well-to-do idlers.


"
Karl Marx,"

On a level plain, simple mounds look like hills; and the insipid flatness of our present bourgeoisie is to be measured by the altitude of its great intellects.


"
Karl Marx,"

There is a specter haunting Europe, the specter of Communism.


"
Karl Marx,"

Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man, just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science: there will be one science.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

When the people you love are gone, you're alone.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

It's always wonderful to get to know women, with the mystery and the joy and the depth. If you can make a woman laugh, you're seeing the most beautiful thing on God's Earth.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Grief changes shape, but it never ends.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Money doesn't mean anything to me. I've made a lot of money, but I want to enjoy life and not stress myself building my bank account. I give lots away and live simply, mostly out of a suitcase in hotels. We all know that good health is much more important.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

The simple act of paying attention can take you a long way.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I am not handsome or sexy. Of course, it's not like I am hopeless.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Falling in love and having a relationship are two different things.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Energy can't be created or destroyed, and energy flows. It must be in a direction, with some kind of internal, emotive, spiritual direction. It must have some effect somewhere.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I believe in love at first sight. You want that connection, and then you want some problems.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

People were saying that David Geffen and I had gotten married and it just blew me away. Not that they thought I was gay, but that they thought I could land a guy that hot.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I'm sorry my existence is not very noble or sublime.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I'm a meathead, man. You've got smart people, and you've got dumb people. I just happen to be dumb.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I try not to think about my life. I have no life. I need therapy.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Kissing someone is pretty intimate, actually very intimate, and your heart always kind of skips a beat before you do that.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

It's fun to be hopelessly in love. It's dangerous, but it's fun.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Sure I believe in God and the Devil, but they don't have to have pitchforks and a long white beard.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

When I don't feel free and can't do what I want I just react. I go against it.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I'm Mickey Mouse. They don't know who's inside the suit.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Here comes 40. I'm feeling my age and I've ordered the Ferrari. I'm going to get the whole mid-life crisis package.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

The whole aspect of cinema and film festivals should be a moment to come together and celebrate art and humanity. It would be a shame if there was such a divide.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

How do I confront aging? With a wonder and a terror. Yeah, I'll say that. Wonder and terror.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I've had the opportunity to work with so many great directors. Different styles, as well, like Gus Van Sant. He just does the casting and the milieu and let's you do your thing, quietly. Bertolucci, who can talk to you about your internal world in quite a creative way or just say, 'Well, put your hand over here.'


"
Keanu Reeves,"

How do people relate to movies now, when they're on portable devices or streaming them? It's not as much about going to the movies. That experience has changed.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Mortality is very different when you're 20 to when you're 50.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I mean, if you didn't get it or if you didn't feel like you enjoyed it, sometimes that experience can change.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

But, you know, it's still a drag to get your picture taken when you're eating a sandwich. It's a downer.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I used to have nightmares that they would put 'He played Ted' on my tombstone.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I've been pleased to work with so many wonderful stars through the years. This has been an amazing journey. I hope it continues.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

It's the journey of self, I guess. You start with this kind of loner, outside guy, which a lot of people can relate to, and he goes out into the world.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I was always interested - I mean, it's kind of part of your job - I was always interested in the camera.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Letters are something from you. It's a different kind of intention than writing an e-mail.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I don't know the law, the kind of law of quantity and quality, but I think the opportunity of people being able to express themselves and to have the means of production is a great thing. It's also changing how we're telling stories.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I'm a meathead. I can't help it, man. You've got smart people and you've got dumb people.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

You want to play another kind of character in another genre, and it's been something I've been trying to do if I can in the career so far, and it's something I hope to continue because it's interesting to me and you get to do different things as an actor.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I just felt that if I went into Speed 2, I just... wouldn't have come up out of the water.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

On a good night, I get underwear, bras, and hotel-room keys thrown onstage... You start to think that you're Tom Jones.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I mean, I went to a Catholic boys' school for a year, but that was to play hockey. Religion class was quite contentious for me.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I do think there must be some kind of interaction between your living life and the life that goes on from here.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

But I think we're also just talking about the literacy of the audience. The visual literacy of the audience. They've seen so many images now, especially here in the States. There's so much to look at, to watch. So the visual storytelling literacy is harder to impress.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I have definitely been curious and involved in the process; even as a young actor. I was always looking at where the camera was, what story it was telling. And as my experience grew, I wanted to know even more.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Because we're actors we can pretend and fake it, but I'd rather the intimate investment was authentic.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

My name can't be that tough to pronounce!


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I am waiting for the right story to tell. Just like 'Man of Tai Chi' just seemed to be the right story to tell. So I'm looking for that. Because I really love directing. I love developing the story. I love actors. I love the cinema of it, the way that you tell a story visually.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

And of course to work with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, and work with a wonderful, beautiful script directed by Nancy Meyers, it was really for me a dream come true.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I had the classic 40 meltdown. I did. It's embarrassing. It was pretty funny. But then I recovered. To me, it was like a second adolescence. Hormonally, my body was changing, my mind was changing, and so my relationship to myself and the world around me came to this assault of finiteness.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I think - I don't know, maybe it's nostalgia. But the choice, losing the choice to be able to use film is going to be - it's gone. It's going to be gone.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

But I did 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.' They made a cereal out of it, so once you've had a cereal, it doesn't get much more surreal than that. Surreal cereal.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Oftentimes, when we think of 3D, we think of things coming out of the screen, but actually, you've got this zero, this negative space, what they call the negative space, which is the scene, what's being filmed in the positive space of the audience. As you can have things come out, you can have all of this depth.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Artists are losing the choice to use film. People have a love for it - the grain, how it feels, the texture.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I've been really fortunate to be able to do different kinds of films in different scales, different genres, different kinds of roles, and that is important to me.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I have a producing partner named Stephen Hamel, and we've been trying to generate material.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I'm not a photographer, so I didn't get into F-stops or ND filters or background, foreground, cross-light, all that stuff. But I was interested in the camera and the lenses. That's the world that I'm moving in, in terms of acting and giving a performance.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

You know what, I'd done an interview show when I was like 16 or 17. One of my first jobs. I did interviews for this television show in Toronto.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

When we talk about how movies used to be made, it was over 100 years of film, literal, physical film, with emulsion, that we would expose to light and we would get pictures.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I think the form, the Hollywood movie, I think the quality is obviously always going to be there and I think that the question of taste, there's always a question of taste.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I want to make a good, solid kung fu movie.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

It's easy to become very self-critical when you're an actor. Then you get critiqued by the critics. Whether you agree with them or not, people are passing judgment on you.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

Basically it starts with four months of training, just basic stretching, kicking and punching. Then you come to the choreography and getting ready to put the dance together.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

The truth is often terrifying, which I think is one of the motifs of Larry and Andrew's cinema. The cost of knowledge is an important theme. In the second and third films, they explore the consequences of Neo's choice to know the truth. It's a beautiful, beautiful story.


"
Keanu Reeves,"

I loved the material when I first read it, and the experience of making the film was a great one. So when we came around to complete the trilogy, I just signed on board without even reading the scripts because the experience of the first film was so good.

Khalil Gibran,"

Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They came through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

The teacher who is indeed wise does not bid you to enter the house of his wisdom but rather leads you to the threshold of your mind.

But let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

If you reveal your secrets to the wind, you should not blame the wind for revealing them to the trees.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

Generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

If your heart is a volcano, how shall you expect flowers to bloom?


"
Khalil Gibran,"

Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

March on. Do not tarry. To go forward is to move toward perfection. March on, and fear not the thorns, or the sharp stones on life's path.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

Poetry is a deal of joy and pain and wonder, with a dash of the dictionary.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.


"

I love you when you bow in your mosque, kneel in your temple, pray in your church. For you and I are sons of one religion, and it is the spirit.

Sadness is but a wall between two gardens.

You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

To be able to look back upon ones life in satisfaction, is to live twice.

Love is trembling happiness.

Faith is a knowledge within the heart, beyond the reach of proof.

And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.

When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

Wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep, too grave to laugh, and too selfish to seek other than itself.


"
Khalil Gibran,"

Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.


"

The lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master.

Of life's two chief prizes, beauty and truth, I found the first in a loving heart and the second in a laborer's hand.

Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Poverty is the mother of crime.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

The only wealth which you will keep forever is the wealth you have given away.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Look within. Within is the fountain of good, and it will ever bubble up, if thou wilt ever dig.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

To the wise, life is a problem; to the fool, a solution.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Everything that happens happens as it should, and if you observe carefully, you will find this to be so.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Here is the rule to remember in the future, When anything tempts you to be bitter: not, 'This is a misfortune' but 'To bear this worthily is good fortune.'


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Life is neither good or evil, but only a place for good and evil.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Do every act of your life as if it were your last.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

The universe is transformation: life is opinion.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Confine yourself to the present.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

A noble man compares and estimates himself by an idea which is higher than himself; and a mean man, by one lower than himself. The one produces aspiration; the other ambition, which is the way in which a vulgar man aspires.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Tomorrow is nothing, today is too late; the good lived yesterday.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Natural ability without education has more often raised a man to glory and virtue than education without natural ability.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Such as are your habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of your mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Anything in any way beautiful derives its beauty from itself and asks nothing beyond itself. Praise is no part of it, for nothing is made worse or better by praise.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

How much time he saves who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Because a thing seems difficult for you, do not think it impossible for anyone to accomplish.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Let not your mind run on what you lack as much as on what you have already.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Adapt yourself to the things among which your lot has been cast and love sincerely the fellow creatures with whom destiny has ordained that you shall live.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Begin - to begin is half the work, let half still remain; again begin this, and thou wilt have finished.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Anger cannot be dishonest.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

To live happily is an inward power of the soul.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Because your own strength is unequal to the task, do not assume that it is beyond the powers of man; but if anything is within the powers and province of man, believe that it is within your own compass also.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Let men see, let them know, a real man, who lives as he was meant to live.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that the nature of the Universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are, and to make new things like them.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

We ought to do good to others as simply as a horse runs, or a bee makes honey, or a vine bears grapes season after season without thinking of the grapes it has borne.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

We are too much accustomed to attribute to a single cause that which is the product of several, and the majority of our controversies come from that.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Be content with what you are, and wish not change; nor dread your last day, nor long for it.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Death is a release from the impressions of the senses, and from desires that make us their puppets, and from the vagaries of the mind, and from the hard service of the flesh.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

To understand the true quality of people, you must look into their minds, and examine their pursuits and aversions.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

The act of dying is one of the acts of life.


"
Marcus Aurelius,"

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note it... Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

More law, less justice.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

To live is to think.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Glory follows virtue as if it were its shadow.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Any man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

An unjust peace is better than a just war.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Friendship improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Nothing is more noble, nothing more venerable than fidelity. Faithfulness and truth are the most sacred excellences and endowments of the human mind.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

It is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgment.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The safety of the people shall be the highest law.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The greatest pleasures are only narrowly separated from disgust.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The sinews of war are infinite money.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The enemy is within the gates; it is with our own luxury, our own folly, our own criminality that we have to contend.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

While there's life, there's hope.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The wise are instructed by reason, average minds by experience, the stupid by necessity and the brute by instinct.

Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

It is the peculiar quality of a fool to perceive the faults of others and to forget his own.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Silence is one of the great arts of conversation.

Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

I prefer tongue-tied knowledge to ignorant loquacity.

Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

When you have no basis for an argument, abuse the plaintiff.

Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

A home without books is a body without soul.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Live as brave men; and if fortune is adverse, front its blows with brave hearts.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Memory is the treasury and guardian of all things.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Love is the attempt to form a friendship inspired by beauty.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Brevity is a great charm of eloquence.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The countenance is the portrait of the soul, and the eyes mark its intentions.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

A room without books is like a body without a soul.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

A man of courage is also full of faith.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

A friend is, as it were, a second self.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Nobody can give you wiser advice than yourself.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The function of wisdom is to discriminate between good and evil.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The pursuit, even of the best things, ought to be calm and tranquil.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Any man is liable to err, only a fool persists in error.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Cultivation to the mind is as necessary as food to the body.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Laws are silent in time of war.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The precepts of the law are these: to live honestly, to injure no one, and to give everyone else his due.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

There is nothing so absurd that some philosopher has not already said it.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

In a republic this rule ought to be observed: that the majority should not have the predominant power.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

What nobler employment, or more valuable to the state, than that of the man who instructs the rising generation?


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

If you pursue good with labor, the labor passes away but the good remains; if you pursue evil with pleasure, the pleasure passes away and the evil remains.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The harvest of old age is the recollection and abundance of blessing previously secured.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

The greater the difficulty, the greater the glory.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Next to God we are nothing. To God we are Everything.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Death is not natural for a state as it is for a human being, for whom death is not only necessary, but frequently even desirable.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

What sweetness is left in life, if you take away friendship? Robbing life of friendship is like robbing the world of the sun. A true friend is more to be esteemed than kinsfolk.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Every man can tell how many goats or sheep he possesses, but not how many friends.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Rightly defined philosophy is simply the love of wisdom.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Natural ability without education has more often attained to glory and virtue than education without natural ability.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Rashness belongs to youth; prudence to old age.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Never go to excess, but let moderation be your guide.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Orators are most vehement when their cause is weak.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

Justice consists in doing no injury to men; decency in giving them no offense.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

No sane man will dance.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

What then is freedom? The power to live as one wishes.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

No obligation to do the impossible is binding.


"
Marcus Tullius Cicero,"

It is the nature of every person to error, but only the fool perseveres in error.


"
Marie Curie,"

Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.


"
Marie Curie,"

You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end, each of us must work for his own improvement and, at the same time, share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful.


"
Marie Curie,"

Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.


"
Marie Curie,"

Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas.


"
Marie Curie,"

I was taught that the way of progress was neither swift nor easy.


"
Marie Curie,"

One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.


"
Marie Curie,"

I am among those who think that science has great beauty.


"
Marie Curie,"

All my life through, the new sights of Nature made me rejoice like a child.


"
Marie Curie,"

I have frequently been questioned, especially by women, of how I could reconcile family life with a scientific career. Well, it has not been easy.


"
Marie Curie,"

A scientist in his laboratory is not a mere technician: he is also a child confronting natural phenomena that impress him as though they were fairy tales.


"
Marie Curie,"

In science, we must be interested in things, not in persons.


"
Marie Curie,"

I am one of those who think like Nobel, that humanity will draw more good than evil from new discoveries.


"
Marie Curie,"

If I see anything vital around me, it is precisely that spirit of adventure, which seems indestructible and is akin to curiosity.


"
Marie Curie,"

When radium was discovered, no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it.


"
Marie Curie,"

There are sadistic scientists who hurry to hunt down errors instead of establishing the truth.


"
Marie Curie,"

I have no dress except the one I wear every day. If you are going to be kind enough to give me one, please let it be practical and dark so that I can put it on afterwards to go to the laboratory.


"
Marie Curie,"

All my mind was centered on my studies, which, especially at the beginning, were difficult. In fact, I was insufficiently prepared to follow the physical science course at the Sorbonne, for, despite all my efforts, I had not succeeded in acquiring in Poland a preparation as complete as that of the French students following the same course.


"
Marie Curie,"

I tried out various experiments described in treatises on physics and chemistry, and the results were sometimes unexpected. At times, I would be encouraged by a little unhoped-for success; at others, I would be in the deepest despair because of accidents and failures resulting from my inexperience.


"
Marie Curie,"

I met Pierre Curie for the first time in the spring of the year 1894... A Polish physicist whom I knew, and who was a great admirer of Pierre Curie, one day invited us together to spend the evening with himself and his wife.


"
Marie Curie,"

Sometimes I had to spend a whole day mixing a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as myself. I would be broken with fatigue at the day's end. Other days, on the contrary, the work would be a most minute and delicate fractional crystallization, in the effort to concentrate the radium.


"
Marie Curie,"

My experiments proved that the radiation of uranium compounds can be measured with precision under determined conditions and that this radiation is an atomic property of the element of uranium.


"
Marie Curie,"

In 1903, I finished my doctor's thesis and obtained the degree. At the end of the same year, the Nobel prize was awarded jointly to Becquerel, my husband and me for the discovery of radioactivity and new radioactive elements.


"
Marie Curie,"

After all, science is essentially international, and it is only through lack of the historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it.


"
Marie Curie,"

During the year 1894, Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me admirable in their form. No one of them was very long, for he had the habit of concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a companion know him as he was.


"
Marie Curie,"

The first experiments on the biological properties of radium were successfully made in France, with samples from our laboratory, while my husband was living.


"
Marie Curie,"

Unknown in Paris, I was lost in the great city, but the feeling of living there alone, taking care of myself without any aid, did not at all depress me. If sometimes I felt lonesome, my usual state of mind was one of calm and great moral satisfaction.


"
Marie Curie,"

The death of my husband, coming immediately after the general knowledge of the discoveries with which his name is associated, was felt by the public, and especially by the scientific circles, to be a national misfortune.


"
Marie Curie,"

In 1906, just as we were definitely giving up the old shed laboratory where we had been so happy, there came the dreadful catastrophe which took my husband away from me and left me alone to bring up our children and, at the same time, to continue our work of research.


"
Marie Curie,"

I was only fifteen when I finished my high-school studies, always having held first rank in my class. The fatigue of growth and study compelled me to take almost a year's rest in the country. I then returned to my father in Warsaw, hoping to teach in the free schools.


"
Marie Curie,"

We should not allow it to be believed that all scientific progress can be reduced to mechanisms, machines, gearings, even though such machinery also has its beauty. Neither do I believe that the spirit of adventure runs any risk of disappearing in our world.


"
Marie Curie,"

Pierre Curie came to see me and showed a simple and sincere sympathy with my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his dream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research, and he asked me to share that life.


"
Marie Curie,"

During the course of my research, I had had occasion to examine not only simple compounds, salts and oxides, but also a great number of minerals.


"
Marie Curie,"

In chemical terms, radium differs little from barium; the salts of these two elements are isomorphic, while those of radium are usually less soluble than the barium salts.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I restore myself when I'm alone.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I'm selfish, impatient, and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I'm out of control, and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Give a girl the right shoes, and she can conquer the world.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Sex is a part of nature. I go along with nature.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Success makes so many people hate you. I wish it wasn't that way. It would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

If you can make a girl laugh, you can make her do anything.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

We are all of us stars, and we deserve to twinkle.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Fame will go by and, so long, I've had you, fame. If it goes by, I've always known it was fickle. So at least it's something I experience, but that's not where I live.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Fear is stupid. So are regrets.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I think that sexuality is only attractive when it's natural and spontaneous.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

It's better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone - so far.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

It's not true I had nothing on, I had the radio on.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Fame is fickle, and I know it. It has its compensations but it also has its drawbacks, and I've experienced them both.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

A strong man doesn't have to be dominant toward a woman. He doesn't match his strength against a woman weak with love for him. He matches it against the world.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Sometimes I feel my whole life has been one big rejection.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I don't know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I don't mind living in a man's world as long as I can be a woman in it.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Beauty and femininity are ageless and can't be contrived, and glamour, although the manufacturers won't like this, cannot be manufactured. Not real glamour; it's based on femininity.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

The real lover is the man who can thrill you just by touching your head or smiling into your eyes - or just by staring into space.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

If I'd observed all the rules, I'd never have got anywhere.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I don't want to make money, I just want to be wonderful.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

It's all make believe, isn't it?


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I am alone; I am always alone no matter what.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

One of the best things that ever happened to me is that I'm a woman. That is the way all females should feel.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

What do I wear in bed? Why, Chanel No. 5, of course.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I have feelings too. I am still human. All I want is to be loved, for myself and for my talent.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

No one ever told me I was pretty when I was a little girl. All little girls should be told they're pretty, even if they aren't.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I like to feel blonde all over.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Respect is one of life's greatest treasures. I mean, what does it all add up to if you don't have that?


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

There is a need for aloneness, which I don't think most people realise for an actor. It's almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you'll let the whole world in on only for a moment, when you're acting. But everybody is always tugging at you. They'd all like sort of a chunk of you.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Dreaming about being an actress, is more exciting then being one.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

A career is wonderful, but you can't curl up with it on a cold night.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I used to think as I looked out on the Hollywood night, 'There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me dreaming of being a movie star.' But I'm not going to worry about them. I'm dreaming the hardest.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

We should all start to live before we get too old.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I know I will never be happy, but I know I can be gay!


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

If I'm a star, then the people made me a star.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Hollywood is a place where they'll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Designers want me to dress like Spring, in billowing things. I don't feel like Spring. I feel like a warm red Autumn.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

The nicest thing for me is sleep, then at least I can dream.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I am involved in a freedom ride protesting the loss of the minority rights belonging to the few remaining earthbound stars. All we demanded was our right to twinkle.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

A woman knows by intuition, or instinct, what is best for herself.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

If there is only one thing in my life that I am proud of, it's that I've never been a kept woman.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

The truth is, I've never fooled anyone. I've let men sometimes fool themselves.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I've never dropped anyone I believed in.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

It's often just enough to be with someone. I don't need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You're not alone.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

A career is born in public - talent in privacy.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Sometimes I've been to a party where no one spoke to me for a whole evening. The men, frightened by their wives or sweeties, would give me a wide berth. And the ladies would gang up in a corner to discuss my dangerous character.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

A smart girl leaves before she is left.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I've been on a calendar, but I've never been on time.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

My dinners at home are startlingly simple. Every night, I stop at the market near my hotel and pick up a steak, lamb chops or some liver, which I broil in the electric oven in my room. I usually eat four or five raw carrots with my meat, and that is all. I must be part rabbit; I never get bored with raw carrots.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Being a sex symbol is a heavy load to carry, especially when one is tired, hurt and bewildered.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I don't know if high society is different in other cities, but in Hollywood, important people can't stand to be invited someplace that isn't full of other important people. They don't mind a few unfamous people being present because they make good listeners.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die young, but then you'd never complete your life, would you? You'd never wholly know you.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

Fame is like caviar, you know - it's good to have caviar but not when you have it at every meal.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I'm very definitely a woman and I enjoy it.


"
Marilyn Monroe,"

I have too many fantasies to be a housewife. I guess I am a fantasy.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

The biggest risk is not taking any risk... In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

By giving people the power to share, we're making the world more transparent.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission - to make the world more open and connected.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Figuring out what the next big trend is tells us what we should focus on.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They're keeping up with their friends and family, but they're also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand. They're connecting with the audience that they want to connect to. It's almost a disadvantage if you're not on it now.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

When you give everyone a voice and give people power, the system usually ends up in a really good place. So, what we view our role as, is giving people that power.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I think a simple rule of business is, if you do the things that are easier first, then you can actually make a lot of progress.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Our goal is not to build a platform; it's to be cross all of them.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

The question isn't, 'What do we want to know about people?', It's, 'What do people want to tell about themselves?'


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

It's not that every single thing that happens on Facebook is gonna be good. This is humanity. People use tools for good and bad, but I think that we have a clear responsibility to make sure that the good is amplified and to do everything we can to mitigate the bad.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

People don't care about what someone says about you in a movie - or even what you say, right? They care about what you build. And if you can make something that makes people's life better, then that's something that's really good.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Our mission is to connect every person in the world. You don't do that by having a service people pay for.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Connectivity is a human right.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I feel that the best companies are started not because the founder wanted a company but because the founder wanted to change the world... If you decide you want to found a company, you maybe start to develop your first idea. And hire lots of workers.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented, and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I wear the same outfit or, at least, a different copy of it almost every day.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I just think that VR and AR are going to be a really big deal.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Move fast with stable infrastructure.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

The thing that we are trying to do at facebook, is just help people connect and communicate more efficiently.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

My goal was never to just create a company. A lot of people misinterpret that, as if I don't care about revenue or profit or any of those things. But what not being just a company means to me is not being just that - building something that actually makes a really big change in the world.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

The only meat I eat is from animals I've killed myself.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Bill Gates has always been a mentor and inspiration for me even before I knew him. Just growing up, I admired how Microsoft was mission-focused.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Right now, with social networks and other tools on the Internet, all of these 500 million people have a way to say what they're thinking and have their voice be heard.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I look at Google and think they have a strong academic culture. Elegant solutions to complex problems.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

All of my friends who have younger siblings who are going to college or high school - my number one piece of advice is: You should learn how to program.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I got my first computer in the 6th grade or so. As soon as I got it, I was interested in finding out how it worked and how the programs worked and then figuring out how to write programs at just deeper and deeper levels within the system.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I think that people just have this core desire to express who they are. And I think that's always existed.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

We want to make it so that anyone, anywhere - a child growing up in rural India who never had a computer - can go to a store, get a phone, get online, and get access to all of the same things that you and I appreciate about the Internet.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Our goal is to make it so there's as little friction as possible to having a social experience.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

In general, we're a social network. I prefer that because I think it is focused on the people part of it - as opposed to some people call it social media, which I think focuses more on the content.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I always tell people that you should only hire people to be on your team if you would work for them.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

We talk about this concept of openness and transparency as the high-level ideal that we're moving towards at Facebook. The way that we get there is by empowering people to share and connect. The combination of those two things leads the world to become more open.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people - and that social norm is just something that has evolved over time.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Hackathons are these things where just all of the Facebook engineers get together and stay up all night building things. And, I mean, usually at these hackathons, I code too, just alongside everyone.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

If we're trying to build a world-class News Feed and a world-class messaging product and a world-class search product and a world-class ad system, and invent virtual reality and build drones, I can't write every line of code. I can't write any lines of code.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Facebook is really about communicating and telling stories... We think that people can really help spread awareness of organ donation and that they want to participate in this to their friends. And that can be a big part of helping solve the crisis that's out there.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

When I was in college I did a lot of stupid things and I don't want to make an excuse for that. Some of the things that people accuse me of are true, some of them aren't. There are pranks, IMs.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

There are different ways to do innovation. You can plant a lot of seeds, not be committed to any particular one of them, but just see what grows. And this really isn't how we've approached this. We go mission-first, then focus on the pieces we need and go deep on them and be committed to them.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Facebook is in a very different place than Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and Microsoft. We are trying to build a community.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

My friends are people who like building cool stuff. We always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable. There's a lot of that in Silicon Valley.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I literally coded Facebook in my dorm room and launched it from my dorm room. I rented a server for $85 a month, and I funded it by putting an ad on the side, and we've funded ever since by putting ads on the side.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Once you have a product that you are happy with, you the need to centralize things to continue growth.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

On engagement, we're already seeing that mobile users are more likely to be daily active users than desktop users. They're more likely to use Facebook six or seven days of the week.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

It's, like, even in journeys like Facebook, we've had some very serious ups and downs.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Video is growing very quickly on Facebook. A lot of people compare that to YouTube. I think that kind of makes sense. YouTube isn't the only video service, but I think it's the biggest, and it probably makes more sense to compare Facebook video to YouTube rather than Netflix because that's a completely different kind of content.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

One of the things that we're trying to do with Creative Labs and all our experiences is explore things that aren't all tied to Facebook identity. Some things will be, but not everything will have to be, because there are some sets of experiences that are just better with other identities.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

At Facebook, we build tools to help people connect with the people they want and share what they want, and by doing this we are extending people's capacity to build and maintain relationships.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Our philosophy is that we care about people first.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

There are really two core principles at play here. There's giving people a voice so that people can express their opinions. Then, there's keeping the community safe, which I think is really important. We're not gonna let people plan violence or attack each other or do bad things.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I don't have an alarm clock. If someone needs to wake me up, then I have my BlackBerry next to me.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Founding a company is hard. Most of it isn't smooth. You'll have to make very hard decisions. You have to fire a few people. Therefore, if you don't believe in your mission, giving up is easy. The majority of founders give up. But the best founders don't give up.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

You get a reputation for stability if you are stable for years.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I started the site when I was 19. I didn't know much about business back then.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

We want Facebook to be one of the best places people can go to learn how to build stuff. If you want to build a company, nothing better than jumping in and trying to build one. But Facebook is also great for entrepreneurs/hackers. If people want to come for a few years and move on and build something great, that's something we're proud of.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I'm trying to make the world a more open place.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

I updated my grilling app, iGrill, today and it now has Facebook integration that lets you see what other people are grilling right now around the world. Awesome.


"
Mark Zuckerberg,"

Facebook is inherently viral. There are lots of sites that include a contact importer, and for lots of them it doesn't really make sense. For Facebook it fits so well. It wasn't until a few years in that we started building some tools that made it easier to import friends to the site. That was a huge thing that spiked growth.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education.

Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.

The time is always right to do what is right.

Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?'


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Whatever your life's work is, do it well. A man should do his job so well that the living, the dead, and the unborn could do it no better.


"

I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.

Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat now.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

We are not makers of history. We are made by history.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable... Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

That old law about 'an eye for an eye' leaves everybody blind. The time is always right to do the right thing.

A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.

"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.


"

All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Capitalism does not permit an even flow of economic resources. With this system, a small privileged few are rich beyond conscience, and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level. That's the way the system works. And since we know that the system will not change the rules, we are going to have to change the system.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

We must build dikes of courage to hold back the flood of fear.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Cowardice asks the question, is it safe? Expediency asks the question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular? But conscience asks the question, is it right? And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because it is right.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon, which cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it. It is a sword that heals.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Never succumb to the temptation of bitterness.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was: 'If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?' But... the good Samaritan reversed the question: 'If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?'

One of the greatest casualties of the war in Vietnam is the Great Society... shot down on the battlefield of Vietnam.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war but the postive affirmation of peace.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

I just want to do God's will. And he's allowed me to go to the mountain. And I've looked over, and I've seen the promised land! I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking. There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions. Nothing pains some people more than having to think.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of reality.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

I am not interested in power for power's sake, but I'm interested in power that is moral, that is right and that is good.


"
"Martin Luther King, Jr.","

Discrimination is a hellhound that gnaws at Negroes in every waking moment of their lives to remind them that the lie of their inferiority is accepted as truth in the society dominating them.

All great achievements require time.


"
Maya Angelou,"

If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.


"
Maya Angelou,"

I have great respect for the past. If you don't know where you've come from, you don't know where you're going. I have respect for the past, but I'm a person of the moment. I'm here, and I do my best to be completely centered at the place I'm at, then I go forward to the next place.


"
Maya Angelou,"

My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.


"
Maya Angelou,"

You are the sum total of everything you've ever seen, heard, eaten, smelled, been told, forgot - it's all there. Everything influences each of us, and because of that I try to make sure that my experiences are positive.

Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.


"
Maya Angelou,"

There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.


"
Maya Angelou,"

Courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.

The truth is, no one of us can be free until everybody is free.


"

Nothing will work unless you do.

We may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated.

Prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future and renders the present inaccessible.


"
Maya Angelou,"

The ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned.


"

It's one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself, to forgive. Forgive everybody.


"
Maya Angelou,"

A wise woman wishes to be no one's enemy; a wise woman refuses to be anyone's victim.

Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.


"
Maya Angelou,"

History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.


"
Maya Angelou,"

It is time for parents to teach young people early on that in diversity there is beauty and there is strength.

Maya Angelou,"

Love is like a virus. It can happen to anybody at any time.


"
Maya Angelou,"

If you find it in your heart to care for somebody else, you will have succeeded.


"
Maya Angelou,"

One isn't necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.


"
Maya Angelou,"

My mother said I must always be intolerant of ignorance but understanding of illiteracy. That some people, unable to go to school, were more educated and more intelligent than college professors.


"
Maya Angelou,"

I learned a long time ago the wisest thing I can do is be on my own side, be an advocate for myself and others like me.


"

Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. But anger is like fire. It burns it all clean.


"

I think we all have empathy. We may not have enough courage to display it.


"
Maya Angelou,"

You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.


"
Maya Angelou,"

What is a fear of living? It's being preeminently afraid of dying. It is not doing what you came here to do, out of timidity and spinelessness. The antidote is to take full responsibility for yourself - for the time you take up and the space you occupy. If you don't know what you're here to do, then just do some good.


"
Maya Angelou,"

I'm convinced of this: Good done anywhere is good done everywhere. For a change, start by speaking to people rather than walking by them like they're stones that don't matter. As long as you're breathing, it's never too late to do some good.


"
Maya Angelou,"

Eating is so intimate. It's very sensual. When you invite someone to sit at your table and you want to cook for them, you're inviting a person into your life.


"
Maya Angelou,"

I have a son, who is my heart. A wonderful young man, daring and loving and strong and kind.


"

It is impossible to struggle for civil rights, equal rights for blacks, without including whites. Because equal rights, fair play, justice, are all like the air: we all have it, or none of us has it. That is the truth of it.

While I know myself as a creation of God, I am also obligated to realize and remember that everyone else and everything else are also God's creation.

Find a beautiful piece of art. If you fall in love with Van Gogh or Matisse or John Oliver Killens, or if you fall love with the music of Coltrane, the music of Aretha Franklin, or the music of Chopin - find some beautiful art and admire it, and realize that that was created by human beings just like you, no more human, no less.


"
Maya Angelou,"

I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands; you need to be able to throw something back.

Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them with deeper meaning.

You may write me down in history with your bitter, twisted lines. You may trod me in the very dirt, but still, like dust, I'll rise.


"
Maya Angelou,"

If we lose love and self respect for each other, this is how we finally die.

You can't forgive without loving. And I don't mean sentimentality. I don't mean mush. I mean having enough courage to stand up and say, 'I forgive. I'm finished with it.'


"
Maya Angelou,"

My great hope is to laugh as much as I cry; to get my work done and try to love somebody and have the courage to accept the love in return.


"
Maya Angelou,"

Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends.


"
Maya Angelou,"

The thing to do, it seems to me, is to prepare yourself so you can be a rainbow in somebody else's cloud. Somebody who may not look like you. May not call God the same name you call God - if they call God at all. I may not dance your dances or speak your language. But be a blessing to somebody. That's what I think.


"
Maya Angelou,"

We are braver and wiser because they existed, those strong women and strong men... We are who we are because they were who they were. It's wise to know where you come from, who called your name.


"
Maya Angelou,"

Most people don't grow up. It's too damn difficult. What happens is most people get older. That's the truth of it. They honor their credit cards, they find parking spaces, they marry, they have the nerve to have children, but they don't grow up.


"
Maya Angelou,"

I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver.

"
Maya Angelou,"

I got my own back.


"
Maya Angelou,"

Our stories come from our lives and from the playwright's pen, the mind of the actor, the roles we create, the artistry of life itself and the quest for peace.


"
Maya Angelou,"

I would be a liar, a hypocrite, or a fool - and I'm not any of those - to say that I don't write for the reader. I do. But for the reader who hears, who really will work at it, going behind what I seem to say. So I write for myself and that reader who will pay the dues.

There is nothing so pitiful as a young cynic because he has gone from knowing nothing to believing nothing.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Letting go helps us to to live in a more peaceful state of mind and helps restore our balance. It allows others to be responsible for themselves and for us to take our hands off situations that do not belong to us. This frees us from unnecessary stress.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.


"
Melody Beattie,"

The new year stands before us, like a chapter in a book, waiting to be written. We can help write that story by setting goals.


"

Feel what you feel, know what you know, and set your relatives free to do the same.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Relationships are where we take our recovery on the road.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Make New Year's goals. Dig within, and discover what you would like to have happen in your life this year. This helps you do your part. It is an affirmation that you're interested in fully living life in the year to come.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Few things can frustrate us more than trying to make a person someone he or she isn't; we feel crazy when we try to pretend that person is someone he or she is not.


"
Melody Beattie,"

What do you do when life blindfolds you and spins you around? We think it's our fault, that we're to blame, when really we should be focused on being gentle with ourselves.


"
Melody Beattie,"

In martial arts, every time you graduate, move to another level, you don't forget everything you've done. You build on it, but it's always there.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Much of the time, the things we feel guilty about are not our issues. Another person behaves inappropriately or in some way violates our boundaries. We challenge the behavior, and the person gets angry and defensive. Then we feel guilty.


"
Melody Beattie,"

I used to be afraid of pain, didn't take a lot of risks, especially in love. I'm not as afraid anymore. I'm more spontaneous, more likely to say what I think.


"
Melody Beattie,"

We can trust ourselves to know when our boundaries are being violated.


"
Melody Beattie,"

It's hard to give up the self-esteem connected to being codependent and appearing 'right,' which is probably a survival behavior learned from growing up in a crazy family. It feels like you will actually disappear.


"
Melody Beattie,"

There are almost as many definitions of co-dependency as there are experiences that represent it.


"
Melody Beattie,"

I gave three years of my life to take care of my dying mother who had Alzheimer's disease. Being there for her every need for three years might have looked codependent but it wasn't because it was what I wanted to do.


"
Melody Beattie,"

We are on a very rich emotional and physical journey on this planet.


"
Melody Beattie,"

I want people who have received a diagnosis of Hepatitis C to know that they didn't just receive a death sentence. They do have options, even if the person who gave them their diagnosis isn't aware of all of them. The path they choose doesn't have to be one of desperation.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Some therapists have proclaimed: 'Co-dependency is anything, and everyone is co-dependent.'


"
Melody Beattie,"

Guilt can prevent us from setting the boundaries that would be in our best interests, and in other people's best interests.


"
Melody Beattie,"

According to some Eastern religion, there is a belt that goes across the world, and I've heard that Minnesota is right in the heart of this spiritual-creative belt of energy.


"
Melody Beattie,"

Twelve-step promotes spirituality, not religion. It gives a practical, day-to-day spirituality that tells me what I can and cannot control. There is room to be imperfect and to be someone who struggles to find God.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.


"
Mother Teresa,"

We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Joy is prayer; joy is strength: joy is love; joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home.

Mother Teresa,"

Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.


"
Mother Teresa,"

If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.


"
Mother Teresa,"

I have found the paradox, that if you love until it hurts, there can be no more hurt, only more love.


"
Mother Teresa,"

If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand.


"
Mother Teresa,"

We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do.


"
Mother Teresa,"

We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry, naked and homeless. The poverty of being unwanted, unloved and uncared for is the greatest poverty. We must start in our own homes to remedy this kind of poverty.


"
Mother Teresa,"

We ourselves feel that what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But the ocean would be less because of that missing drop.


"
Mother Teresa,"

The miracle is not that we do this work, but that we are happy to do it.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Peace begins with a smile.


"
Mother Teresa,"

The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her own child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me? There is nothing between.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do... but how much love we put in that action.


"
Mother Teresa,"

The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Intense love does not measure, it just gives.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Being unwanted, unloved, uncared for, forgotten by everybody, I think that is a much greater hunger, a much greater poverty than the person who has nothing to eat.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Let us touch the dying, the poor, the lonely and the unwanted according to the graces we have received and let us not be ashamed or slow to do the humble work.


"
Mother Teresa,"

If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.


"
Mother Teresa,"

There must be a reason why some people can afford to live well. They must have worked for it. I only feel angry when I see waste. When I see people throwing away things that we could use.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Each one of them is Jesus in disguise.


"
Mother Teresa,"

One of the greatest diseases is to be nobody to anybody.


"
Mother Teresa,"

I want you to be concerned about your next door neighbor. Do you know your next door neighbor?

Let us not be satisfied with just giving money. Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need your hearts to love them. So, spread your love everywhere you go.


"
Mother Teresa,"

I try to give to the poor people for love what the rich could get for money. No, I wouldn't touch a leper for a thousand pounds; yet I willingly cure him for the love of God.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Many people mistake our work for our vocation. Our vocation is the love of Jesus.


"

There is always the danger that we may just do the work for the sake of the work. This is where the respect and the love and the devotion come in - that we do it to God, to Christ, and that's why we try to do it as beautifully as possible.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Even the rich are hungry for love, for being cared for, for being wanted, for having someone to call their own.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Let us more and more insist on raising funds of love, of kindness, of understanding, of peace. Money will come if we seek first the Kingdom of God - the rest will be given.


"
Mother Teresa,"

Our life of poverty is as necessary as the work itself. Only in heaven will we see how much we owe to the poor for helping us to love God better because of them.
